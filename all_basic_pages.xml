    <Description>Want some history and culture with your glass of old-vine Zinfandel? California&amp;amp;#39;s nascent wine industry took flight during the Gold Rush of the 1850s, amid the rugged western foothills of the majestic Sierra Nevada mountain range. As fortune seekers, many of them European, flocked to the Sierras to prospect for gold, small wineries arose to help slake their thirst. Within a few decades, there were more wineries in the area known as the Mother Lode than in any other region of California. Some of the vineyards planted during that era survive to this day.&#13;
Regrettably, the decline of gold mining at the end of the 19th-century, followed by the advent of Prohibition in 1920, devastated the Sierras&amp;amp;#39; frontier wine community, which lay dormant until the late 1960s. Then, a new generation of pioneers began migrating to the Gold Country, this time drawn by the region&amp;amp;#39;s rolling, sun-drenched hillsides, warm climate, and volcanic, decomposed granite soils - - ideal conditions for producing quality wine grapes. When their robustly flavored Amador wines, especially zinfandel, began attracting the attention of wine lovers throughout California and the U.S., the historic Sierra foothill wine region was reborn.&#13;
Today, where gold once reigned, twenty-five wineries produce a new treasure: the superb wines which have earned Amador County international recognition.&#13;

    <Description>Amador County Fairgrounds, with its rolling green lawns, stately old oak trees and immaculately groomed buildings and grounds, has gained the statewide reputation of having one of the prettiest fairgrounds in the West. OPEN YEAR-ROUND!&#13;
&#13;
Backing the 100&amp;amp;#39; x 200&amp;amp;#39; arena, an authentic miniature frontier town graces the wooden boardwalk, and takes you back into the great Mother Lode atmosphere.&#13;
&#13;
Throughout the year, the grounds lend themselves to individual, club and organizational usage. Facilities are available at nominal cost for dances, dinners, weddings, receptions, trailer rallies, picnics, horse shows, rodeos and numerous other activities too abundant to mention. The annual Amador County Fair is held at the end of July and is credited with being one of the few remaining true old time county fairs.&#13;

    <Description>For untold generations had the small bands of Miwuk Indians inhabited the hills and valleys, rivers and creeks, alpine lakes and Sierra peaks of today&amp;amp;rsquo;s Amador County, a California gem tucked between Central Valley and High Sierra.Then, Miwuk men hunted and fished, and seasonally moved their bands to escape lowland heat or follow the harvest of acorns and other eatables in their diet. Miwuk women made home out of various rancherias, and ground acorns andother foodstuffs at various grinding rocks in in or near creek and stream.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the legacy of Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s known first inhabitants has been preserved and exhibited at the county&amp;amp;rsquo;s Chaw-Se Indian Grinding Rocks State Historic Park, near Volcano, the state&amp;amp;rsquo;s only park dedicated to the culture of Miwuk and other California Indians. Its feature, of course, is a 7,700 square-foot limestone monolith with more than 1,185 mortar holes which Miwuk women, wielding pestles, made by grinding their acorns and other foodstuffs for hundreds of years. Moreover, more than 363 petroglyphs are also etched into nearby rocks.&#13;
&#13;
Except for probable encounters with other Indian bands in the region, the Miwuk had what is now Amador much to themselves until Ensign Gabriel Moraga, early in the 19th century, led a Spanish exploration party across the land. The fabled Jedediah Smith a quarter-century later was first to cross the Sierra west to east, but there&amp;amp;rsquo;s no evidence he tracked through today&amp;amp;rsquo;s Amador.&#13;
&#13;
In the 1840s, two incursions into Miwuk and Mexico&amp;amp;rsquo;s territory made history. First, in 1843-44, the John C. Fremont expedition crossed the Sierra in mid-winter near today&amp;amp;rsquo;s Carson Pass. His route once was in Amador County before it begat Alpine in 1864. The second entry was by John Sutter&amp;amp;rsquo;s hands from Sutter&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fort. By at least 1844 his scouts first found a cedar and pine forest upstream from today&amp;amp;rsquo;s Sutter Creek, and other men, and some women and children, too, seasonally lived at the whipsaw and charcoal pits on the ridge. This would be the first non-Indian habitation in the county&amp;amp;rsquo;s and perhaps Sierra&amp;amp;rsquo;s history. In fact, the first wagon road in the Sierra, was not to Coloma, but to Sutter&amp;amp;rsquo;s Pine Woods.Had Sutter had a sawmill at Pine Woods, someone might have discovered gold earlier. But that outdoor manufactory was high on a ridge and no running brook or creek lured the men to pan for gold.&#13;
&#13;
On January 25, 1848, at Sutter&amp;amp;rsquo;s saw mill in Coloma, James Marshall spied that celebrated chispa which led, soon, to the &amp;amp;ldquo;world rushing in.&amp;amp;rdquo; Thus, in 1848, did Miwuk, native but non-Indian Californios, Sonorans from Mexico, Kanakas from Hawaii, Mormons and American soldiers and settlers try their luck at scooping placer gold - gold loosened from the source rock - in rivers, creeks and gulches throughout the Sierra foothills. Amador had its share, including many soldiers in Jonathan Stevenson&amp;amp;rsquo;s New York Infantry Regiment who deserted or got leave from bay area camps to prospect, principally along the Mokelumne River.&#13;
&#13;
One of those native Californios who left rancho to mine in what is now Amador was Jose Maria Amador, former majordomo of San Jose Mission lands, who mined on a small creek in 1848 and early in 1849. His presence named the creek &amp;amp;ldquo;Amadore&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;Amador&amp;amp;rdquo; and would later name the county when it split off from Calaveras in 1854.&#13;
&#13;
Another prominent history-maker mining here was John Sutter. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s unknown whether he ever visited Pine Woods, his Sierra foothill camp, but it&amp;amp;rsquo;s documented that he, and his party including Indians and Kanakas, mined another creek in the summer of 1848. His presence named creek and city, now Sutter Creek. For three years the placer mining area brought thousands from world-wide into the gold counties, and sent most home busted and wiser.&#13;
&#13;
Then, in late 1850, and in this county, spring of 1851, gold fever was reignited with discoveries of gold in quartz rock. Experienced or wiser miners followed loose gold to its source, or located quartz rock outcroppings which they uncovered and hounded through the earth. Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s first quartz discoveries were along Amador Creek. Just upstream from today&amp;amp;rsquo;s village-city, Thomas Rickey and others discovered what became the Original Amador Mine, but was first named Amador County Mine #1. Across the creek, on the same ledge butanother claim, S.A. Davidson, a Baptist minister from Tennessee, and a quartet of Methodist ministers, discovered gold in what became the Spring Hill Quartz Mining Company. Hence, it was called the Minister&amp;amp;rsquo;s Mine or Claim, surely the only mine in those avaricious times, discovered and owned by altruistic Christian ministers.&#13;
&#13;
Those discoveries and others along the madre veta or mother lode veins made permanent many Amador camps which might have vanished. By the mid-1850s, in the new gold rush, most camps like Jackson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Creek, Sutter Creek, Amador City, Ione, and Volcano boasted surveyed streets, brick or stone buildings and other signs of permanency in the gold country.&#13;
&#13;
Amid that second rush was born Amador County, a scion of Calaveras County, on June 14, 1854, even though Calaveras officials, as the law required, never approved the contested results of that election. That didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t deter Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s new leaders. They formed the county anyway and never looked back. Wags called the county illegitimate!&#13;
&#13;
he 1850s saw some mines hit rich pockets of ore, and then fail when the gold pocket pinched out. Most quartz mines cost their partners more than they made until the late 1850s when in Sutter Creek erstwhile attorney Alvinza Hayward, superintendent and then owner of the Badger Mine, hit paying rock, bought out the adjoining Eureka, and formed the Hayward or Amador Mine, which by 1870, made Hayward perhaps the state&amp;amp;rsquo;s first mining millionaire and the Amador the richest mine in the state. There were rumors and even a suit filed by Eureka shareholders that some of those riches actually came from the Eureka before Hayward bought it!&#13;
&#13;
Another mine, the Keystone, got its start in 1853, a union of several small claims. It suffered through bankruptcy more than once, but from the 1860s into the 1890s, was the county&amp;amp;rsquo;s most productive mine. In Sutter Creek, the Summit Mine evolved over the years into the Central Eureka, including Hayward&amp;amp;rsquo;s old mine closed by fire, and it reaped dividends until after world war II, the last major Amador mine to close. Plymouth had its rich mine, too, the Phoenix or Empire or first Plymouth Consolidated, which before an 1888 fire, was perhaps the state&amp;amp;rsquo;s richest mine, and made the new town of Plymouth the mining center of the county.&#13;
&#13;
But more celebrated in gold mining history were the gemini of Amador mines, the adjoining Kennedy and Argonaut near Jackson. Both got started in the 1850s, the latter as the claim of black men. After various ownerships, incorporated owners, successes and failures, both mines finally struck steady pay shutes in the late 1880s and early 1890s. After that, they made owners wealthy and produced great profits until World War II closed them, never to reopen.&#13;
&#13;
In the Argonaut Mine, in 1922, occurred the state&amp;amp;rsquo;s worst mining disaster when a deep mine fire trapped 47 miners working below the flames. A valiant rescue effort from the Kennedy finally reached the men, as the world watched newsreels and newspapers for the result. Alas, they had all died from gases loosed by the fire just hours after they were trapped. In Jackson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Serbian Orthodox, Catholic and Community (then Protestant) cemeteries lie the 47 victims of the tragedy and fitting memorials.&#13;
&#13;
World War II changed everything. All the mines closed in 1941 and men and women were needed for the war effort. After the war, when the mines didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t reopen - Central Eureka did for a while - the county looked toward tourism, gambling and girls to boost the economy. The latter lasted until the mid-1950s and timbering and lumber mills took center stage.&#13;
&#13;
Amador, so close to metropolitan Sacramento and Stockton, and not that far from San Francisco, lured many to its gold towns and other attractions from near sea level to almost 10,000 feet in the Sierra. The construction of dams backing Lake Amador and Lake Camanche in the 1960s added fishing and water sports. The McLaughlin and Lucot familiesturned their private family Daffodil Hill garden into a regional magnet each spring luring thousands.&#13;
&#13;
Also in the spring Jackson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Dandelion Days on St. Patrick&amp;amp;rsquo;s weekend beckons thousands, too. And, in the 1970s, Kirkwood Ski Resort was developed at Zach Kirkwood&amp;amp;rsquo;s old meadow and surrounding peaks, necessitating opening of Highway 88 year round. The City of Jackson created a park around the unique Kennedy Tailing Wheels, probably the most photographed mining relic in the gold country. And more, much more.&#13;
&#13;
Amador, a lure in any season, is home to 38,000 or so year-round, and thousands more who come to see, camp, recreate, ski, sail or motor their boats.&#13;

    <Name>Amador Sawmill</Name>
    <Menu-Group>In and Around</Menu-Group>
    <PlaceTags>Plymouth</PlaceTags>
    <Description>The Amador Sawmill is one of the last operational steam powered sawmills in California. The sawmill is operated by Amador Sawmill and Mining Association, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization supplying rough-cut lumber and timbers for projects that require time-period saw marks for their restoration. The sawmill is a living history museum using turn of the century (1890-1910) steam power operated by volunteers. The Amador Sawmill&amp;amp;rsquo;s mission is preservation and education by acquiring, restoring and preserving authentic historic working sawmill equipment, and to provide Public education through display and demonstration.&#13;
&#13;
The Amador County Fair features live operation of the steam powered sawmill on the Amador County Fairgrounds. &amp;amp;ldquo;You haven&amp;amp;rsquo;t experienced the Amador County Fair if you haven&amp;amp;rsquo;t seen this sawmill operate&amp;amp;rdquo;, said Ken McCoy, long time volunteer and docent.&#13;
&#13;
The authentic 19th century sawmill is run by the powerful 1907 Corliss single cylinder steam engine with a 7 ft. flywheel, and will once again turn giant logs into useful boards as they pass through the 48&amp;amp;rdquo; circular blade.&amp;amp;nbsp; The1890 Smith &amp;amp;amp; Sayer steam engine will again come to life to drive the sawdust removal conveyor.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the huffing and puffing engines, and flying sawdust, there will be an expanded machine tool exhibit featuring restored 19th and 20th century machine tools. Included will be a circa 1907 Sebastian lathe which originally was used to make shell casings for the U.S. Navy. Also on display will be a Rockford Horizontal Milling Machine of the same vintage. The tools will be operating as originally configured with power being transmitted from an overhead line shaft.&#13;
&#13;
On the logging side, an operating Steam Donkey similar to those used to pull logs out of the woods in 19th century Amador Couny will be fired up. The steam-driven winches will be operated by docents who will provide overviews and conduct tours.&#13;
&#13;
All are welcome to visit the demonstrations and talk to the volunteers who build and operate the exhibit. Learn how the Steam Donkey&amp;amp;rsquo;s Dutton boiler is fired up and the history of its use on a pile driving barge in San Francisco Bay. Watch the sawmill crew muscle a huge log onto the carriage that moves it through the 48&amp;amp;rdquo; saw blade. Watch as the Sawyer communicates with hand signals to direct the efforts of setters and off-bearers. Take a look in the Engine Room and be hypnotized by the rhythmic machinery huffing and puffing, turning steam into 60 horse power.&#13;
&#13;
According to Bill Braun, President of the Amador Sawmill &amp;amp;amp; Mining Association (ASMA), &amp;amp;ldquo;Fulfilling our mission to restore and demonstrate historic equipment is fun, but more important is our increased ability to educate young people about their American heritage. By recreating a live 19th century Sawmill, we provide a glimpse into Amador County history and one of the three traditional industries here, Logging, Mining, and Agriculture&amp;amp;rdquo;.&#13;

    <Description>&#13;
The Amador Whitney Museum exists to promote an interest in the history and culture of the Mother Lode region among both residents and visitors. It will do this with particular emphasis on the contributions and experiences of women who have lived in the Mother Lode, from the distant past to the present day.&#13;
&#13;
This building, originally the Kling Building is probably the oldest commercial building in town. It dates back to 1860. Throughout the years, it has housed many types of businesses including the Wells Fargo Drayage Company. Most recently, the building was owned by two gentlemen, Jerrold Whitney, and Clayton Pinkerton. Mr. Whitney was a gregarious antique dealer, and Mr. Pinkerton was a well known Bay Area artist. Upon their deaths, they bequeathed the building to the city of Amador to be used as a museum. In 1993 the building became known as the Amador Whitney Museum.&#13;

    <Description>&amp;amp;ldquo;The richest placers will yet be found in our vineyards, which will afford homes for a greater and happier population than our richest mines. -- J.D. Mason, 1864&#13;
&#13;
Eric J. Costa&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Old Vines&#13;
&#13;
History of Wine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Eric J. Costa, Food, Wine and Spirits Guide&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;ldquo;While the story of the Gold Rush is known to nearly everyone, very few people realize that Amador County was also home to one f the most important pioneer agricultural regions in California.&amp;amp;nbsp; In the Sierra foothills, agriculture has always been considered the step-child of gold mining, and would not have existed at all, had it not been for the market created by the influx of miners from all corners of the world. Nevertheless, sizable vineyards, orchards, and gardens were established soon after the major gold strikes. Adjacent to the very streams that virtually bubbled with placer gold, and on the hillsides that were home to gold bearing veins, farming soon began. It was &amp;amp;ldquo;after the Gold Rush&amp;amp;rdquo;, however, when the mines began to play out, that a considerable number of the citizens of Amador County turned to agriculture as a means of supporting themselves. Not a few of these earliest agriculturists were from Europe, and many had experience growing fruit or making wine in the old country.&amp;amp;nbsp; It was mostly these people who established Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s earliest fruit ranches and vineyards.&amp;amp;nbsp; Today, the remains of some of the native stone buildings they constructed, and even some of the old vineyards and orchards they planted can be found along some of the county&amp;amp;rsquo;s scenic back roads.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#13;
&#13;
California&amp;amp;rsquo;s nascent wine industry took flight during the Gold Rush of the 1850s, amid the rugged western foothills of the majestic Sierra Nevada mountain range. As fortune seekers, many of them European, flocked to the Sierras to prospect for gold, small wineries arose to help slake their thirst. Within a few decades, there were over 100 wineries in the area known as the Mother Lode, more than any other region of California. Some of the vineyards planted during that era survive to this day.&#13;
&#13;
The decline of gold mining at the end of the 19th-century, followed by the advent of Prohibition in 1920, devastated this frontier wine community, which remained dormant until the late 1960s. Then, a new generation of pioneers began migrating to the Gold Country&amp;amp;rsquo;s Amador County, this time drawn by the region&amp;amp;rsquo;s rolling, sun-drenched hillsides, warm daytime temperatures, and volcanic, decomposed granite soils &amp;amp;ndash; ideal conditions for producing top-quality wine grapes. When their robustly flavored wines, especially zinfandel, began attracting the attention of wine lovers throughout California and the U.S., the historic Sierra Foothills wine region was reborn.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Premium Varieties&#13;
&#13;
Amador County is well known for its Zinfandel and Barbera vineyards, some of which date to 1856. The ideal growing conditions within the county have allowed for broad diversification of the grapes grown. Amador County vineyards are now also producing world-class Rhone, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese varieties. For a listing of wine grapes and for further information on the varieties grown in the Amador County&amp;amp;#39;s appellations, visit Amador Wine Grape Growers premium varieties.&#13;
&#13;
The French word &amp;amp;rdquo;terroir&amp;amp;rdquo; describes a particular combination of the soil and climate that gives the grapes (therefore the wine) its flavor. The rocky soil and warm temperatures have made Amador County an ideal location for growing Rhone varieties. The best of the Amador County Viogniers compete with the much-sought-after French Condrieus from the northern Rhone valley. Winemakers also are producing well-regarded Roussannes, Marsannes, and Vermentinos from Amador&amp;amp;#39;s vineyards.&#13;
&#13;
Appellation and Terrain&#13;
&#13;
As diverse as the wine grape varieties planted, so are the conditions in which they are grown. Amador&amp;amp;#39;s vineyards range from an elevation of 250 feet in the western foothills to 2900 feet in the east. Summer daytime temperatures range from the eighties to more than one hundred degrees, while nighttime temperatures dip into the fifties and sixties due to breezes from the Sacramento Delta and the Sierra Nevada mountains. Such a diurnal temperature shift is good for the grapes because the sunshine produces high acids and high sugar content while the temperature drop stabilizes the acid balance in the fruit.&#13;
Another factor that differentiates the grapes in Amador County is the jumble of the soils, from alluvial to decomposed granites, fertile to not-so-fertile, level to steep, and fine to coarse-textured. Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s two major sub-appellations are Shenandoah Valley and Fiddletown, both in the northern part of the county near the small town of Plymouth. Stylistically, zinfandels from the Shenandoah Valley tend to be fuller, riper and earthier with a characteristic dusty, dark berry fruit character, hints of cedar, anise and clove spice, and scents of raisin and chocolate. By comparison, zinfandels from the Fiddletown appellation, a smaller, higher-elevation region east of Shenandoah Valley, tend to be lower in pH and display a fruitier, more cherry-like fruit tone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TERROIR&#13;
&#13;
Most of the Sierra Nevada was one big monolith and it was pushed up when the North American plate slammed into the Pacific plate. Our geology is that of a tumultuous history of lifting, folding, and pressure resulting in a heterogeneous collection of soils.&#13;
&#13;
VINEYARD ASPECT&#13;
&#13;
Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s wine grape plantings are small vineyard plots of land wedged in areas between granite boulder outcroppings and big pastures of unplanted grass lands.&amp;amp;nbsp; Akin to a mosaic or patchwork quilt, small vineyard plots are angled at different exposures and elevations.&#13;
&#13;
WINEMAKING&#13;
&#13;
Our mosaic vineyard feature has shaped the approach of Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s grape growers and winemakers to be highly experimental and innovative. Individualists are willing to take risks while prospecting the possibility of each small site for varietal selection and clonal diversity. Growers and winemakers must work closely in tandem as each vineyard plot expresses itself uniquely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wine Tasting Tips&#13;
&#13;
Swirl, smell and sip. Swirl the wine gently to all ow it to coat the glass and add oxygen, &amp;amp;#39;opening up&amp;amp;#39; the wine&amp;amp;#39;s aromas and flavors. Smell is very important for experiencing the wine, along with the sip you take after you smell the wine in your glass.&#13;
&#13;
3 sip protocol: 1st sip cleanses your palate. 2nd sip sets up your palate to taste. 3rd sip allows you to taste the wine.&#13;
&#13;
Ask questions.&#13;
&#13;
Take notes.&#13;
&#13;
Relax and enjoy.&#13;
&#13;
Thanks for visiting Amador County&amp;amp;#39;s wine tasting rooms and wineries.&#13;

    <Description>Sutter Creek, the jewel of Amador County and the Gold Country, has blossomed from a sleepy antiquing town into a Foothills wine destination, with nine wine tasting rooms within walking distance on Main Street (see www.wineonmain.com), new eateries, upscale shopping, and many B&amp;amp;amp;B&amp;amp;#39;s along with the Hotel Sutter. Both Bella Grace locations host wine, olive oil and balsamic tastings, and provide beautiful venues for private parties and wine club events. From May until early October, the Sutter Creek tasting room offers a Friday night concert series, featuring live music from area artists, food catered by local restaurants, and award winning Bella Grace wine by the glass or the bottle. Bring your lawn chair or blanket to sit on the grass and enjoy music and atmosphere under the stars.

    <Description>Experience the best of Jackson, California, including wineries, the famous Kennedy Mine and the Amador County Museum, at this pet friendly hotel.&#13;
	&#13;
	Just a short trip from Sacramento, Reno and Lake Tahoe, the Best Wester Amador Inn sits comfortably amongst the rolling foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains - once famous for the great California Gold Rush. Take the day and visit the Kennedy Mine, the deepest vertical gold mine in the world around the turn of the century, now a prominent destination site for both families and adventurers alike. Then head to nearby historic downtown Jackson&amp;amp;#39;s famed antique shops or the thrilling Jackson Rancheria Casino that sits only three miles away.&#13;
	&#13;
	Nature lovers can also get their fill at this scenic Jackson hotel with Chaw-Se State Historical Park, Amador Lake and Comanche Lake all just a short drive away. If your visit is in the springtime, be sure to see the spectacular blooms on Daffodil Hill - an attraction that draws tourists each year from all around the region. Or, if you&amp;amp;#39;re a wine connoisseur, don&amp;amp;#39;t miss out on why Amador County is often called the second Napa Valley - the wineries in the area are delicious and quite fun to visit.&#13;

    <Description>Spring is signaled when the bluebirds arrive. These brightly colored birds sometimes raise two groups of young in a season. When the meadowlark sings, summer is on its way. Canada geese can be viewed in our skies and stopping at local ponds and lakes when they make their migration each direction. In the dead of winter, Eagles&amp;amp;#39; nests can be viewed from the water while traveling around Lake Pardee.&#13;
&#13;
Wildlife is part of our daily lives. Most common are the deer, skunks, raccoons, and wild turkeys. Travel on some of the quieter roads, and you may see coyote, bobcat, fox, and an occasional mountain lion. Remember outdoor safety rules while viewing the wildlife. If you are unsure, ask a local ranger at our parks.&#13;

    <Name>Black Chasm Cavern</Name>
    <Menu-Group>Things to Do</Menu-Group>
    <PlaceTags>Volcano</PlaceTags>
    <Description>Located here in Amador County, just outside the quaint village of Volcano, Black Chasm Cavern was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1976 after being recommended by local members of the National Speleological Society, and as such is considered a &amp;amp;quot;nationally significant natural area.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;Visitors to the cave are enchanted by the beauty of a wide variety of formations including stalactites, stalagmites, flow-stones and the vast arrays of rare helictite crystals, for which Black Chasm Cavern is justly famous. Above ground, kids love our Gemstone Mining at our mining flumes right outside the Visitors Center.&#13;
&#13;
On the 50-minute guided walking tour, descend a series of stairs and walkways that loop around the formation covered caverns walls.&amp;amp;nbsp; Here, flowstone interspersed with stalactites, draperies and helictites compete for space above the stairways. In the Colossal Room, a platform seemingly suspended in midair hangs above a 80-foot drop to small glimpses of the jewel-like Lake Reflection below, made bright turquoise by naturally occurring calcium bicarbonate.&#13;
&#13;
Visit the 3,000 square foot visitors center and gift shop with displays from the Matrix movie trilogy (Black Chasm was the inspiration for the huge cavern set in the second &amp;amp;amp; third movies). Learn about the recent exploration &amp;amp;amp; mapping of the cave, and browse the science, nature, and souvenir merchandise, including a large selection of minerals to start or expand upon your gem and mineral collection.&#13;

    <Description>Water recreation is available year-round in Amador County. In colder months, locals keep to the bodies of water in lower elevations, like Lake Amador, Camanche Lake, and Pardee Reservoir. In the heat of the summer, they&amp;amp;nbsp;all head up to higher elevations for relief from the hot days. Silver Lake, Woods Lake, Blue Lake are all wonderful spots for dropping a line.&#13;

Hand-Crafted spirits designed for taste, smoothness, and quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Founded in Jackson, CA in 2012, Amador Distillery creates small&amp;amp;nbsp;batch spirits by blending the finest ingredients&amp;amp;nbsp;from&amp;amp;nbsp;local&amp;amp;nbsp;vintners,&amp;amp;nbsp;brewers,&amp;amp;nbsp;and&amp;amp;nbsp;our&amp;amp;nbsp;talented farming community. Our local water&amp;amp;nbsp;supply originates high in the Sierra Nevada which gives us extremely&amp;amp;nbsp;clean, neutral water that allows the flavor of our spirits to shine&amp;amp;nbsp;through. We bottle our spirits in small batches by hand so each&amp;amp;nbsp;bottle is given our personal attention.&amp;amp;nbsp;All Engine 49 handcrafted Whiskies and Bourbons experience a&amp;amp;nbsp;deeper aging process in the&amp;amp;nbsp;Sierra&amp;amp;nbsp;foothills.&amp;amp;nbsp;Rapid&amp;amp;nbsp;daily temperature swings and a lack of humidity stress the American Oak&amp;amp;nbsp;barrels causing deeper penetration of the staves. This gives our&amp;amp;nbsp;Whiskies richer color, aroma, and taste. &#13;
&#13;
Our unique Brandies are made from 100% fruit with no added flavoring, concentrates, coloring, or sweeteners of any kind, and aged in oak barrels that have previously been used to age whiskey or wine which adds great flavor and richness.&#13;
&#13;
We source local fruit to create our unique and delicious brandies, including local apples, plums, blueberries, cherries, pears and a variety of grapes. Our brandies are made from 100-% fruit with no added flavoring, concentrates, coloring, or sweeteners of any kind. &#13;

    <Description>Casa de la Pradera(house in the meadow) is a farm stay bed and breakfast on a working organic farm.&amp;amp;nbsp; It overlooks a meadow, &amp;amp;nbsp;and is a short walk over the hill from Sierra foothills village of Fiddletown and its historic buildings, and is only three miles from the Shenandoah Valley and its wineries. &amp;amp;quot;The Casa&amp;amp;quot; is not just a Bed and Breakfast, but also a small working CSA (community supported agriculture) farm that&amp;amp;nbsp; produces vegetables, herbs, apples, olives and eggs for local farmers markets. &amp;amp;nbsp;This is an authentic farm stay. &amp;amp;nbsp;While the farmhouse is a newer building constructed fifteen years ago, the Kaiser family, your host, &amp;amp;nbsp;has been on the &amp;amp;nbsp;land for over 50 years. &amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Set in the peace and quiet of the country, you will hear nothing but frogs at night, and birds awakening you in the morning. &amp;amp;nbsp;It offers a wonderful escape from city life, a place to unwind and ground oneself in authentic country life-- and even learn a bit about organic gardening before you head out to a local winery- or continue &amp;amp;nbsp;on to the High Sierra. &amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
A very family friendly place to stay--kids especially love to&amp;amp;nbsp;feed the chickens and help collect eggs, and help pick vegetables in the gardens; also perfect for couples looking for a quiet, romantic retreat, and individuals seeking a pleasant, private but not too isolated country visit. Come enjoy the country at Casa de la Pradera!&#13;

The park was created in 1968 and preserves a great outcropping of marbleized limestone with some 1,185 mortar holes -- the largest collection of bedrock mortars in North America.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

The museum features a variety of exhibits and an outstanding collection of Sierra Nevada Indian artifacts. A Miwok village complete with a ceremonial roundhouse has been reconstructed in the middle of the small valley.&amp;amp;nbsp; It has been designed to reflect the architecture of the traditional roundhouse. Exhibited in this two-story museum are outstanding examples of the technology and crafts of the Miwok and other Sierra Nevada native American groups.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;

    <Description>The &amp;amp;quot;Chew Kee&amp;amp;quot; is a Chinese rammed earth structure established as an herb shop during the Gold Rush. Dr. Yee Fong Cheung, an herb doctor who was operating the store in the early years, came to America to administer to the medical needs of the Chinese miners, later also tending to the Chinese railroad workers. In the 1880&amp;amp;#39;s a man known only by his store name of &amp;amp;quot;Chew Kee&amp;amp;quot; owned the shop and was providing groceries and supplies to the Chinese community. By 1910, however, there were only four Chinese Americans residing in Fiddletown. In 1922, Chew Kee deeded the property to his &amp;amp;quot;adopted&amp;amp;quot; son, Fong Chow Yow, also know as Jimmy Chow. Jimmy Chow worked in Fiddletown, living in the old herb store until his death in 1965. &amp;amp;quot;Chew Kee&amp;amp;quot; remains largely intact as one of only four remnants of the once thriving Chinese community in Fiddletown.&#13;

    <Description>Cooper Vineyards believes that winemaking begins in the vineyard and at Cooper Vineyards, farming in the Shenandoah Valley of Amador County spans five generations. Cooper history is embedded in the soil our vines thrive in.&amp;amp;nbsp;Thanks to the winemaking talent of Michael Roser, they&amp;amp;nbsp;offer an exciting portfolio of seventeen wines. Their&amp;amp;nbsp;boutique production of hand-crafted wines allows us to sell out frequently, often within six months of a release date. When you find a favorite, we encourage you to order early.&#13;

    <Menu-Group>Places to Stay</Menu-Group>
    <PlaceTags>Jackson</PlaceTags>
    <Description>My husband, small dog, and I stayed here in mid-October. The motel is next to a creek and Kennedy park. The motel has several small buildings with a few hotel rooms in each. Some have patio doors and patios overlooking the creek. The grounds are nicely landscaped with plenty of picnic tables and chairs. The hotel is about a mile from downtown Jackson in a mostly residential are. It&amp;amp;#39;s very quiet with no loud bars or zooming traffic nearby.&#13;
	&#13;
	Our room was a small but very comfortable Queen room with 20&amp;amp;quot; TV with cable, mini fridge, and microwave. Decor is guest room style, not motel style and the rooms are very clean. I read in their brochure that they also have family-style rooms and rooms with King beds.&#13;
	&#13;
	Our room rate included a continental breakfast of coffee, sweet rolls, and juices. The motel owners were very sweet and provided lots of literature about the nearby mine. There is a $100 deposit for dogs, fully refundable if they don&amp;amp;#39;t do their business in your room.&#13;
	&#13;
	I&amp;amp;#39;d recommend this to any one looking for a cozy, private, homestyle room.&#13;

    <Description>McLaughlin&amp;amp;rsquo;s Daffodil Hill is a multi-generational project which has it&amp;amp;rsquo;s origin in a family garden dating from the late 1800&amp;amp;rsquo;s. Today it has become a full scale tourist destination attracting thousands annually to this beautiful site near Volcano.Daffodil Hill is in a beautiful alpine setting at an elevation of over 3,000 feet. With pine trees, an old barn, wagon wheels, and rusting mining equipment and farming tools, it appeals to anyone with a love of nature. Flowers are everywhere, with pea-fowl, chickens, pigeons and lambs making themselves at home.&#13;
&#13;
Approximately 7 acres of the 540 acre Daffodil Hill ranch is dedicated to&amp;amp;nbsp;daffodils.&amp;amp;nbsp;It features as many as 300 varieties and, if the weather cooperates, in excess of 400,000 annual blooms. The number of bulbs planted each year depends, in large part, upon the donations&amp;amp;nbsp;received from&amp;amp;nbsp;welcome guests. There is no admission charge or parking fee to visit&amp;amp;nbsp;the family ranch, but&amp;amp;nbsp;they do have yellow teakettles and pots around so that anyone, if they desire, may donate to&amp;amp;nbsp;the project.Nature sets the schedule for public viewing. Daffodil Hill opens when 25 percent of the flowers are in bloom and closes when only 25 percent remain.&#13;
&#13;
Open daily during blooming season&#13;
&#13;
Typically Mid-March thru mid-April&#13;
&#13;
10am to 4pm.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Call ahead, especially if the weather has been wet or snowy.&#13;

    <Description>Established in 2007, Distant Cellars was founded as a family venture driven by a passion for wine with the idea of &amp;amp;ldquo;good times over great wine&amp;amp;rdquo; at its heart. Looking to remove the pretentious qualities associated with robust and complex wines, Distant Cellars strives to make their winery and wines approachable to wine enthusiasts of all levels while maintaining an intriguing and powerful product that is sure to spark conversation.&#13;
&#13;
Distant Cellars vines are mostly dry farmed and only irrigated when necessary to protect the crop and allowed to ferment on the natural yeast from the vineyard. The wine is gently racked and allowed to age up to 24 months in charred American and French oak barrels, creating an ultra premium and complex wine. Focusing on traditional and natural wine making techniques, they let their wines represent the region and vintage they came from with minimal intervention, believing wine is made best in conjunction with nature, not against it. This natural approach is applied from the initial planting and pruning of the vines, to the fermentation, barreling,&amp;amp;nbsp;finishing, and through the final bottling, which is done with the utmost care to ensure we create a truly unique wine that speaks&amp;amp;nbsp;from the heart, the land, and individuality of the terroir.&#13;

    <Description>Dog-Friendly Vacation Rental&#13;
&#13;
Escape to a 60-acre private paradise for people and pets.&amp;amp;nbsp; This luxurious hilltop home has spectacular sunset views, sleeps 7, and is close to Pine Grove, Jackson, and Sutter Creek.&amp;amp;nbsp; Amenities abound starting with a huge gourmet kitchen that is ideal for entertaining, spacious rooms with pine-vaulted ceilings and extra features such as double-sinks/showers.&amp;amp;nbsp; Plenty of entertainment options are available including a big screen TV with Direct TV and Netflix, WiFi internet, a large game room with foosball, ping pong, and darts, plus a basketball court outside.&amp;amp;nbsp; A covered patio provides a perfect place to watch the sun set over neighboring vineyards, and then light up the fire pit and gaze at the stars while listening to the crickets chirp.&#13;
&#13;
What makes the Dog &amp;amp;amp; Pony Ranch so special are the features that have been designed for 4-footed family members who are not only &amp;amp;ldquo;pets considered&amp;amp;rdquo; but pets welcome!&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; No extra charges for well-behaved pets (unless damages).&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The house has been designed with features such as stained concrete floors and leather furniture that are dog-fur resistant as well as beautiful. Outside there are miles of well-marked private trails for dogs to roam off-leash on the private fenced 60-acre property.&amp;amp;nbsp; Many dogs&amp;amp;rsquo; favorite feature is the large swimming pond. Yes, people can enjoy the hiking and swimming too, but we think it&amp;amp;rsquo;s so much better with man&amp;amp;rsquo;s best friend by your side!&#13;

    <Description>It began in 1993, when Rudy Chinco purchased 41 rolling acres in California&amp;amp;#39;s Shenandoah Valley. The region is noted for its intense, rich Zinfandels and other zesty reds. Rudy, his son Chris, and daughter Cathy worked side by side, planting their vineyards and laying plans for the winery, which opened 10 years later. Antique cars and tractors seemed to make their way to the winery and the family decided to build a home for the collection and create a destination for others who share their enthusiasm for wine and vintage cars. You can taste their&amp;amp;nbsp;wines at the&amp;amp;nbsp;winery on Steiner Road or at their&amp;amp;nbsp;tasting room in Sutter Creek.&#13;

    <PlaceTags>Drytown</PlaceTags>
    <Description>Drytown was the first community established in northern Amador County, and the first in which gold was discovered. It took its name from Dry Creek, which runs dry during the summer. However, it was certainly not &amp;amp;quot;dry&amp;amp;quot;, as stories tell of there being up to 26 saloons, of which just one remains, The Drytown Club.&#13;
&#13;
The gold started to peter out by 1857 and when a fire destroyed most of the town that year, most of its inhabitants packed up and moved to more successful mines elsewhere in the county. The town was only saved by the construction of State Route 49, which went through it, in 1920.&#13;

    <Description>The legend is that fiddle-playing miners from Missouri named the flat and town. By the late 1850&amp;amp;rsquo;s, Fiddletown had a sizable Chinese community and a rare Chinese rammed earth adobe. Today that adboe is the Chew Kee Store, with a collection of a Chinese Herb doctor&amp;amp;rsquo;s medicinal artifacts. Once a year musicians arrive from near and far to play music at the Fiddlers Jam. This free event brings plenty of audience to listen and applaud.&#13;

The &amp;amp;quot;Chew Kee&amp;amp;quot; store is a Chinese rammed earth structure established as an herb shop during the Gold Rush.&amp;amp;nbsp; By 1910, there were only four Chinese Americans residing in Fiddletown. In 1922, Chew Kee deeded the property to his &amp;amp;quot;adopted&amp;amp;quot; son, Fong Chow Yow, also know as Jimmy Chow. Jimmy Chow worked in Fiddletown, living in the old herb store until his death in 1965. &amp;amp;quot;Chew Kee&amp;amp;quot; remains largely intact as one of only four remnants of the once thriving Chinese community in Fiddletown.&#13;
	&#13;
	The store is open on Saturday from noon to 4 p.m., April through October.&#13;

Dave Helwig had a dream to move to the wine country upon retirement. After searching with his wife, Nancy, for the perfect wine region to relocate to from their home in Southern California, Dave couldn&amp;amp;rsquo;t resist the charm and simplicity the Shenandoah Valley of Amador County had to offer. Dave, Nancy, and Scott Helwig look forward to planting their roots (literally and figuratively) and producing wines to be enjoyed with friends, family, and great food. Helwig offers concerts and live entertainment.&amp;amp;nbsp;They&amp;amp;nbsp;encourage you to visit their&amp;amp;nbsp;site regularly to view updated photos, information about their&amp;amp;nbsp;wines, and events on the calendar.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

    <Description>Gold Country Wine Retreat - Hillcrest Cabin&#13;
&#13;
Welcome to the Hillcrest Cabin, a luxury, hillside retreat situated along the picturesque Shenandoah Wine Trail. We are located in the quaint and quirky village of River Pines, which is conveniently centered amongst two world-class wine regions: The Shenandoah Valley of Amador County, and the Fairplay AVA of El Dorado County. The nearest winery is only one mile down the road, and there are more than 50 wineries within a 10 mile radius to enjoy! The neighborhood was originally built in the 1920&amp;amp;rsquo;s as a vacation resort, but has since become a popular community for retirees. Visitors will enjoy the same regional activities the locals do including: wine tasting, hiking, boating, fishing, cavern tours, and sightseeing at the many Gold Rush era sites and historic towns.&#13;
&#13;
The cabin sits on a hillside double-lot dotted with tall oaks, pine trees and interesting rock outcroppings. Perched in the treetops, you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll feel a sense of serenity and privacy, even with neighbors nearby. The property offers a spacious outdoor area dedicated for picnics, campfires and good conversation.&#13;
&#13;
Brand new central heat &amp;amp;amp; air, new doors, windows, hardwood flooring, paint, and fixtures. Guests will appreciate stylish amenities and furnishings throughout the home including king size beds, luxury bedding and linens, plus attractive artwork and accessories. The home offers a fully remodeled and stocked kitchen with brand new shaker cabinets, quartz counters and GE slate appliances. The designer bathrooms were fully re-built offering a clean and modern aesthetic. We also offer our guests a brand new LED HDTV with DVD player and bluetooth sound system. In addition, there&amp;amp;#39;s a full-sized front loading washer and dryer set.&#13;
&#13;
We are proud to be a pet friendly vacation rental. Guests are welcome to bring their well-behaved and well-groomed canine companions (sorry, no cats). An additional fee applies per pet, and helps us cover the added expense of hosting four legged guests. We have dog beds onsite as well as food and water bowls. Please note that our property is not fenced, so our cabin is best suited for dogs that will not wander or stray. We do have an outdoor stake with extended tethers so your pups can roam safely and enjoy some outdoor time with you.&#13;

    <Description>&amp;amp;quot;There is a rich, almost seductive opulence to this brick 1879 hostelry that comes at you in whispers and peeks.&amp;amp;quot; (Sunset Magazine) Featured in Wine Spectator Magazine as a recommended place to stay in the Sierra Foothills and Gold Country wine regions. Step back in time to 1879 when the Gold Rush was in full swing, Amador City was a bustling mining town, and the Imperial Hotel opened its doors to prosperous Victorian hotel guests. Today the miners are gone, but Amador City retains its historic character. The beautifully restored Imperial Hotel still offers a warm and gracious welcome to visitors to the Gold Country for dining, celebrating your wedding or group event, or for a lovely get-away experience.&#13;

    <Description>In 1853, Thomas Rickey subdivided land on the stage road from Sacramento and named it Ioneville. Before &amp;amp;rsquo;53, miners panned for gold along all creeks in the valley. Historians differ, but most likely &amp;amp;ldquo;I own it&amp;amp;rdquo; evolved into Ione. By 1894, the iconic Preston Castle began as a reformatory for youth, housing inmates from San Quentin and Alcatraz. In 1904, a short-line railroad company, Ione &amp;amp;amp; Eastern, constructed eleven miles of track from Ione to Martell. Among Ione&amp;amp;rsquo;s finest at Ernie Bonham, New York Yankee pitcher, and jazz giant, Dave Brubeck, who attended Ione High School.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

    <Description>At the crossroads of Scenic Highways 49 and 88, Gold Country adventures begin and end in Jackson. Charming, 150-year old Main Street boasts one of California&amp;amp;rsquo;s oldest and most notorious establishments, the newly renovated National Hotel. Antiques, the Amador County Museum, gift shops, popular eateries, even a steam punk-themed bookstore attract shoppers and history buffs.&amp;amp;nbsp; A Gold Country adventure isn&amp;amp;rsquo;t complete without experiencing the miner&amp;amp;rsquo;s way of life on a tour of the legendary Kennedy Mine. Minutes from Main Street, the Jackson Rancheria Casino Resort features top name entertainers, and Jackson&amp;amp;rsquo;s location on beautiful Highway 88 makes it the ideal base camp for High Sierra camping, fishing, and snow sports.&#13;
&#13;
In 1853, Jackson became the county seat of newly formed Amador County, California. Previously, from 1851&amp;amp;ndash;1852, it had been the county seat of Calaveras County. Jackson may therefore be the only city to have ever been county seat of two different counties at different times.&#13;

    <PlaceTags>Plymouth</PlaceTags>
    <Description>All of Jeff&amp;amp;#39;s wines share a theme of fresh fruit reflective of the varietal flavors inherent in the grapes. Jeff selects grapes from vineyards that provide rich full flavors without loads of astringent tannins. Their&amp;amp;nbsp;wines are characterized by a fruit forward nature to both the aroma and flavor that provides a good representation of the grape used to make the wine. This is followed by a depth, richness, and complexity that is enhanced by aging in small oak barrels. Their&amp;amp;nbsp;wines finish with a smooth aftertaste where the tannins are soft and mature. His&amp;amp;nbsp;mantra as a winemaker is to pack as much flavor and character into a wine as possible without stepping over the line and making a wine so tannic that aging is required to balance and round the wine. This is not to say that their&amp;amp;nbsp;wines won&amp;amp;#39;t age. They will. It&amp;amp;#39;s just that they don&amp;amp;#39;t need to in order to be enjoyed. &amp;amp;quot;We work very hard to produce balanced wines. Wines that will age and become more complex with time, but wines that can also be enjoyed in their youth.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;

    <Name>Kennedy Tailing Wheels Park</Name>
    <Menu-Group>Things to Do</Menu-Group>
    <PlaceTags>Jackson</PlaceTags>
    <Description>The Kennedy and most gold mines in California had to close in 1942 during World War II. Most, including the Kennedy, did not reopen after the war or ever again.&amp;amp;nbsp; Hence, the Kennedy Mining and Milling Company disincorporated in 1950 and sold its mine, real property, and plant to its last superintendent, Mark Eudey, and wife Frances. They, in 1955, deeded Wheels 1 &amp;amp;amp; 2 and a half acre holding them to the County of Amador.&amp;amp;nbsp; Those wheels, however, were landlocked with no access.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Kennedy Wheels, protected by corrugated steel sheds, operated with few interruptions 24-hours a day, from 1914 until the U.S. Government closed the mine in 1942.&amp;amp;nbsp; Soon after, when the price of scrap metal soared, the wheels sheds were dismantled revealing the wheels to the world and the elements for the first time in 28 years.They soon became a Mother Lode mining tourist attraction and were probably the most photographed relic of the quartz mining era in California.&amp;amp;nbsp; They also became part of the (City of) Jackson Wheels Park.&#13;
&#13;
The State of California, Amador County and the City of Jackson all have made major investments to preserve two of four Kennedy Tailing Wheels, the most significant relics of the state&amp;amp;#39;s golden age of quartz mining.&amp;amp;nbsp; They are unique; they are iconic.&amp;amp;nbsp; Now, they should survive for generations to come.&#13;

    <Description>The Kirkwood Inn celebrated its 150th year of friendly western hospitality, and remains one of the best watering holes and eateries in the High Sierra. The Inn sits at the intersection of Alpine, Amador and El Dorado county lines. The Alpine/Eldorado county line actually runs right through the old bar room.&amp;amp;nbsp; Rumor has it that during Prohibition, the bar was on wheels so it could be rolled across the county lines and out of the jurisdiction of the visiting sheriff. And the slot machines were hidden in the kitchen.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

    <Description>Celebrate California&amp;amp;#39;s Pioneer Heritage with the colorful Kit Carson Mountain Men.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
In the California Gold Country, the Kit Carson Mountain Men are best known for leading wagon train reenactments, including the Kit Carson Days Wagon Train on Highway 88, the Highway 50 Wagon Train, and now, Days of 49 Wagon Train along historic Highway 49.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Kit Carson Mountain Men perform every year inside Frontier Village at Amador County&amp;amp;#39;s Fair, which runs the last full weekend in July. They can be seen in the Italian Picnic Parade in Sutter Creek the first weekend in June, and at Christmas Delights Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
For 75 years, the Kit Carson Mountain Men have seen many unique participants and have accumulated more stories than can be retold.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Originally, this group of men called to preserve the traditions of early American fur traders, were called the &amp;amp;ldquo;Whiskerinos.&amp;amp;rdquo; The Whiskerinos changed their name to Kit Carson Mountain Men and incorporated in 1940. &amp;amp;ldquo;Mountain Honeys&amp;amp;rdquo; -- later changed to Women of the West &amp;amp;ndash; also participate in reenactments with the Kit Carson Mountain Men.&#13;

Numerous well-known individuals have visited the Mountain Men in Amador County including Andy Griffith, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, John Ford, Ken Curtis and more.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Ronald Reagan and Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s Saddle: When Ronald Reagan was the Governor of California, local horseman Harold Cummins provided Reagan with a spotted Appaloosa horse. The horse was renamed &amp;amp;ldquo;Amador&amp;amp;rdquo; in honor of the Mountain Men. Reagan, also a member of the Mountain Men, rode Amador in parades throughout the region, including the annual Kit Carson Days parade in Jackson. The mountain men rode behind Reagan in the parade and current Mountain Man President John Queirolo inherited Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s saddle.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Mountain Men and The Queen:&amp;amp;nbsp; The Queen of England came to Sacramento in 1983 and specifically requested to see Sutter&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fort and the Mountain Men, after reading a magazine article about the Mountain Men. In Jackson, during a Mountain Men meeting, a stranger walked in wearing a suit and tie. When the men in their coonskin caps and buckskins saw him, they called out, &amp;amp;ldquo;We don&amp;amp;rsquo;t allow ties in here! Cut it off!&amp;amp;rdquo; One of the Mountain Men, Bill Reed, cut off the man&amp;amp;rsquo;s tie. However, when the man informed the boisterous group that he was with the FBI, sent by request of the President of the United States on behalf of the Queen of England, the Mountain Men quieted down. John Queirolo was in charge of the Queen&amp;amp;rsquo;s visit and the organization of the Mountain Men to be her honor guard at Sutter&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fort. After the Queen&amp;amp;rsquo;s visit, Queirolo discovered that one of the Mountain Men, who had been in the club for 14 months, was an FBI agent sent to ensure the Queen&amp;amp;rsquo;s safety.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

    <PlaceTags>Amador City</PlaceTags>
    <Description>Legendre Cellar wines are made in a traditional method: hand sorted, small-batch fermented, aged in French and American oak barrels, and bottled without fining or filtering. This handmade process results in food-friendly wines that have a luscious texture and a bright palate.&#13;
&#13;
Founded in 2009, Legendre Cellars is a family owned winery located in Fiddletown, California.&amp;amp;nbsp; Selected their hillside site in Amador County for the region&amp;amp;rsquo;s unique ability to produce the highest quality Rhone varietal grapes. Viticulture has been practiced here since California&amp;amp;rsquo;s 1849 Gold Rush, but the area has seen a resurgence as winemakers discover that the unique geography of the region produces an ideal terroir for Mediterranean varietal grapes, such as those commonly found in the Rhone Valley of France. Legendre Cellars works with small local growers to select the best grapes from the region.&#13;

    <PlaceTags>Sutter Creek</PlaceTags>
    <Description>Miners&amp;amp;#39; Bend is&amp;amp;nbsp;an amazing historical display of gold-mining artifacts from the Argonaut, Sutter, and other gold mines.&#13;
&#13;
Along with the mining artifacts, the new park will have informative plaques, picnic benches, trees and &amp;amp;ldquo;Chinese&amp;amp;rdquo; rock walls lining the park. The mining artifacts are from our colorful past, most of which have been donated by our local Amador County mines and other generous donors.&#13;
&#13;
The park&amp;amp;rsquo;s centerpiece, a 5-Head Stamp Mill built at Sutter Creek&amp;amp;rsquo;s Knight Foundry in1882 is donated by the Louis Boitano Family. A replica of a head frame with a winch, motor, mine shaft and an ore car, or skip as it was called, has been erected next to the park entrance. The Skip was donated by the descendants of the John (Jack) Tone Family and was used in his mine in the Rail Road Flat Mining District.&#13;
&#13;
Open and accessible every day, interesting for families and history buffs alike.&#13;

    <Name>Monteverde Store Museum</Name>
    <Menu-Group>Things to Do</Menu-Group>
    <PlaceTags>Sutter Creek</PlaceTags>
    <Description>The Monteverde General Store Museum, located in the heart of the California Gold Country and right on the 49&amp;amp;#39;er Gold Rush Trail, is an excellent example of a perfectly preserved General Store from the mid 1800&amp;amp;#39;s. The picturesque Monteverde Store is a wonderful historical location that gives you a glimpse into how things were in the Wild West. This particular building, with all its history and significance to the people of Sutter Creek and their ancestors, is definitely a must see while in the Sierra Nevada Foothills.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Monteverde Store was opened by John Monteverde and his son John, as a country store in 1896 and still displays all paraphernalia of the past on its shelves. Dry goods, hardware, bulk products, apparel, patterns, even penny candy were on hand for local shoppers. Well preserved, it is now a museum.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Museum is free to visit and generally open on weekends, through the generosity of volunteers. &#13;
&#13;
For a guaranteed tour, please call the Sutter Creek Visitor Center in advance for a volunteer docent-led exploration of the store and the history of the Monteverde Family. &#13;

    <Name>Opal Street House</Name>
    <Menu-Group>Places to Stay</Menu-Group>
    <PlaceTags>Sutter Creek</PlaceTags>
    <Description>Opal Street House is a two-bedroom cottage set in a former orchard (now a large private garden with great fruit trees), one mile from the center of Sutter Creek&amp;amp;rsquo;s historic Main Street and an ideal location for exploring Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s Gold Rush towns, wineries, special attractions. The house is also a great base for day trips to Tahoe, Sacramento and exploring the historic Highway 49 and scenic Highway 88 corridors.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Ideal for two-four guests, featuring old-fashioned front porch (with a swing), central heat and air, French doors, hard wood floors in the living areas, carpet in bedrooms, great natural light, a mix of antiques and comfortable modern furnishings--and thoughtful details throughout. We offer one king-size bed and one queen-size bed&amp;amp;mdash;both outfitted with luxury linens, our bookshelves are well-stocked, and we keep complimentary popcorn, a bottle of our favorite local wine and our favorite Philz coffee from San Francisco along with other essentials waiting for you in the pantry. If you&amp;amp;#39;d like us to stock the fridge or enhance what&amp;amp;rsquo;s in the pantry before you arrive, we&amp;amp;#39;re happy to arrange for an array of items. We&amp;amp;#39;re also happy to help make arrangements for a special occasion (chilled champagne? flowers?)--just let us know. Once you arrive, our house book will help you explore the area with plenty of local insider tips (from our favorite local butcher to the closest hot springs and a full schedule of local and regional events).&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Other specific amenities:&#13;
Central heat and air, wi-fi, washer and dryer, stereo system (use with your i-pod/i-pad), a gas range with oven and broiler, garbage disposal, dish washer, and a full-sized fridge. The bathroom features a tub/shower combination and complimentary luxury bath products. Our enclosed, attached garage provides parking for a single car and our private drive area has ample space for up to two additional vehicles. We do not have a microwave, a land-line phone, or TV--this house is about unplugging and enjoying &amp;amp;#39;la dolce vita&amp;amp;#39;.The garden that surrounds the house is planted with heritage roses, lilacs, grapes, fruit and nut trees.

&#13;
Lower elevations of 900 feet are often used as starting points for many rides. Lakes Amador, Camanche and Pardee all have year-round fishing. Pardee and Camanche rent boats. Hiking and horse trails are also available in these areas.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The middle ground has hills that&amp;amp;nbsp;separate Sutter Creek, Amador City, and Jackson and not many miles between them. Runners, &amp;amp;nbsp;walkers and cyclists use back roads between towns, planning to finish up at a local eatery. River swimming in the Mokelumne River or hiking the canyon along the banks is a local activity.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The peaks up to 9,000 feet have breathtaking views without the crowds that are part of Eldorado National Forest and Mokelumne Wilderness. Fishing moves to higher elevations as the weather warms. Locals spend time at Plasse&amp;amp;#39;s Resort every summer, a jumping-off point for recreation. Kayak and boat rentals are available and the restaurant on-site allows for nights off from cooking. With the deepest, driest snow around and some of North America&amp;amp;#39;s most diverse and challenging terrain,&amp;amp;nbsp;Kirkwood Mountain Resort offers big mountain riding with small town attitude.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Pick your elevation and your season. Every day is full of recreation in Amador County.&#13;

    <Description>For many generations Northern Sierra Miwok lived, traded and traversed the foothills and mountains of the Sierra Nevada. In 1844, non-Indians first crossed the high Sierra when Fremont&amp;amp;rsquo;s Expedition, in deep snow, surmounted the range, thanks to several mountain-man immortals- Kit Carson, Alex Godey, Thomas Fitzpatrick.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The search for gold spread east and into the mountains. Miners and gold-panners could be found all over the Upcountry; in Pine Grove, along the Mokelumne River, in Buckhorn, or in long gone places called Tom &amp;amp;amp; Dick or Pick and Drill.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
For almost two centuries, people have been attracted to Upcountry; the sparkling mountain lakes; grassy meadows with glassy smooth ponds; profuse wildflowers; deep river canyons; dramatic mountain passes; and the rich diversity of recreation and history to be found&#13;

    <Description>Pokerville and Puckerville preceded Plymouth along the old stage road between Fiddletown and Sacramento. When the Plymouth Mine hit rich rock by 1870, a new village named Plymouth rose, adjacent to the mine. Plymouth is home to Amador County Fairgrounds, established in 1938 by the late Harold Colburn and other citizens. Grape growing and wine making began in the county in the early 1850s. Plymouth hosts the oldest planting of Zinfandel grapes in the United States. An agricultural history museum, Shenandoah Valley Museum, resides at the longest-running winery in Amador County, Sobon Estates.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

    <Description>Preston School of Industry, also known as Preston Castle, was formerly one of the oldest and best-known reform schools in the United States. It is located in Ione, California. The institution was opened in June 1894 when seven wards (minors under the guardianship of the state, but not necessarily juvenile offenders), were transferred there from San Quentin State Prison. The original building, known colloquially as Preston Castle (or simply The Castle) is the most significant example of Romanesque Revival architecture in the Gold Country. It was vacated in 1960, shortly after new buildings had been constructed to replace it. The abandoned building has since been named a California Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Ione Gold Country location provides a convenient central point for exploring the local countryside. Ione is surrounded by gently rolling hills, cattle ranches and farms, and fish-filled lakes. Within the city of Ione itself, there are lots of activities, things to do and places to stay.&#13;

    <PlaceTags>Plymouth</PlaceTags>
    <Description>Recreation, Lodging and Weddings.&amp;amp;nbsp; Rancho Cicada is a relaxing, nature-oriented resort located on 44 acres along the Cosumnes River in Amador County, 50 miles east of Sacramento in the historic Gold Country, nestled in the Sierra Nevada Mountain foothills.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Tent cabins and small cabins situated along the river and fully self contained larger cabins available year-round.&amp;amp;nbsp; The beautiful river valley radiates healing energies. The native Mi-Wok Indians had a large fall season encampment on the site, which is evident from all the riverside grinding rocks.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
In addition to fishing and swimming in the Cosumnes river, guests enjoy snorkeling (bring masks for snorkeling and air mattresses for floating), rafting &amp;amp;amp; Innertubing, (some innertubes provided; BYO recommended), hiking (many miles of trails). There is a large hot-tub,&amp;amp;nbsp;and the extensive lawn is a perfect place to play games, host a party, or simply relax in the hammocks set up in the shade.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
There are two 900-square foot decks available for gatherings, dancing, or group meetings. You won&amp;amp;#39;t find a more beautiful and natural setting to hold your event, reunion or outdoor wedding! Hosts David and Bill invite you to come and discover nature&amp;amp;#39;s magic.&#13;

    <Description>From just above sea level, to just below 10,000 feet, Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s elevation variances open the door to more adventures than you could shake a stick at. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s a shame the settlers were so focused on panning and mining, or they might have had more fun.&#13;
	&#13;
	Be careful not to let the quiet appearance of the Amador communities mislead you. For those communities represent the calm before the storm, places of rest and recovery from the outdoor experiences awaiting you.&#13;
	&#13;
	If links are on your mind, dust off your foot wedge. The rolling hills are sure to challenge your &amp;amp;quot;lies.&amp;amp;quot; If water wets your appetite, the Mokelumne river is a whitewater paradise. If you would like to see middle earth, mine tours can take you deep into the wet and dark doldrums of old mining shafts. If you have a penchant for claustrophobic and dark settings, then spelunking (cave exploring) is sure to challenge your senses. For high-country exploration, Salt Springs reservoir offers a variety of outdoor experiences from camping and hiking, to biking and rock climbing. Kirkwood, rated as one of Amercia&amp;amp;rsquo;s best ski resorts, represents the highest of Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s elevation at nearly 10,000 feet.&#13;
	&#13;
	Just a simple drive along Highway 88 from the lowlands to the highlands is breathtaking.&#13;

    <Description>In the 1920s, developers Roy and Helen Brooke found suitable land along the south fork of the Cosumnes in the Bridgeport district, and developed River Pines Resort to sell cabin sites. By damming the river, the resort developed water activities and sports. With the resort thriving for a time, the Brookes subdivided more land for lots. In time, the resort became just another rural, remote community with a post office and store and lots of privacy. By May of 1926, Brooke had engaged Cassius M Phinney, surveyor and civil engineer, to subdivide some of the property bounded northerly by the Cosumnes River, and southerly by the Plymouth-Aukum county road.&#13;

    <Description>Discover the serenity of Amador County&amp;amp;hellip; where sounds of footsteps on the boardwalks echo off the overhanging balconies. Lean on a hitching post, where dirt once supported the hooves of horses. Imagine a time past, yet preserved, in the small communities that still dot these rolling hills.&#13;
	&#13;
	From one perspective, not much has changed in Amador County. From the mines of old to the wines of new, Amador has progressed through a natural change of nature&amp;amp;rsquo;s assets. Although the mining head frames still appear on distant hills, they have been quieted over time. The remnants of deep shafts reflect a proud heritage of hardworking emigrants who braved long journeys in search of new and better lives in California. Those who discovered better lives, relished in them. Those who failed, made an even greater mark on history, for they are the ones history books are written about to illustrate the solid American values of self-reliance and hard work.&#13;
	&#13;
	With their hands and hearts, settlers built towns out of tents&amp;amp;hellip; with each filling a special need. Drytown was dry. Jackson was the center of trade and commerce, while Sutter Creek &amp;amp;ndash; just two hills over &amp;amp;ndash; centered its energies on entertaining the weary and wealthy. Amador City, Volcano, Plymouth, Fiddletown, Ione, and others, completed the synergy of all the towns and people that made the historic 49er era one of the most notable periods in American history. It is, perhaps, the pinnacle of the settling west.&#13;
	&#13;
	Journey with us as we rediscover Amador County, a place of hidden vines in golden times.&#13;

    <PlaceTags>Shenandoah Valley</PlaceTags>
    <Description>The California Shenandoah Valley is an American Viticulture Area that includes portions of Amador County and El Dorado County. The region was first settled during the California Gold Rush in the nineteenth century, and settlers in the region began planting the first grapevines and producing the first wine soon thereafter. In 1983 region became a designated American Viticulture Area. Shenandoah Valley is the westernmost and, therefore, the least elevated and warmest region within the&amp;amp;nbsp;Sierra Foothills. The high temperatures result in very ripe fruit and full-bodied, high alcohol wines. Many&amp;amp;nbsp;wineries are open daily for wine tasting and tours&amp;amp;nbsp;located in the Shenandoah Valley.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

    <Description>Passion to create a small Main Street business is almost a forgotten concept in &amp;amp;#39;e-tail&amp;amp;#39; America, but not here. Amador County is enriched with shopkeepers, whose passion is displayed on every shelf or rack. Each business owner hand picks items for their store, making the store a reflection of the owner&amp;amp;#39;s passion. Every individual piece speaks to them, and the concept they want to convey. They make it available for you to enjoy and even, purchase.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Whatever your interests may be for shopping, something will appeal. One store may not be your cup of tea and the next one may be off the charts for you. Whether you are into antiques or chic fashions and everything in between, it&amp;amp;rsquo;s all here.&#13;
&#13;
Have you ever visited a kitchen store with that tool you didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t know existed? Stop in Jackson at Biggest Little Kitchen Store. Have you ever been to a Gallery where all of the jewelry is one of a kind and made in the USA? Gifted in Jackson or Fine Eye Gallery in Sutter Creek, each have a different take on this philosophy. How about a store that has thousands of music boxes and collectibles, or a book store with a large selection of out-of-print books and a steampunk vibe? Sutter Creek Music box Company and Hein and Company, respectively, fill the bill. Have you ever been to a garden store that specializes in antiques or seen glass-blowing as it actually happens? Bellflower Garden in Amador City and Antique Gardener in Sutter Creek enhance their gardens with sculptures and garden d&amp;amp;eacute;cor. Find a cheese shop that lets you sample exotic cheeses for free, or a wine tasting room that has olive oil tasting, too. For those who love antiques, discover an antique store that has a large warehouse that you can wander through or small antique stores that have articles from the 1800&amp;amp;rsquo;s on.&#13;
&#13;
From shabby chic to just plain Chic, you will find a range of fashion boutiques for every style. Adorable, one of a kind children&amp;amp;rsquo;s clothes are available as well.&#13;
&#13;
Amador County is rich in artists of all kinds. The galleries display original artwork in categories that will delight your senses. And for home d&amp;amp;eacute;cor, our stores cannot be beat. From the smallest of items to interior decorators, all your home decorations can be found here.&#13;
&#13;
Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s shopping could be summed up with tread-worn words like: Home D&amp;amp;eacute;cor, Fashion, Antiques, Gifts, and Art. That would be a travesty to classify these stores built on passion. Yes, you will find all that here, but with care and thoughtfulness. One of a kind, is a better analogy for the caliber of stores here. Come and shop with us and you will find the passion for yourself here in Amador County.&#13;
&#13;
Bargain Hunting requires a love for &amp;amp;lsquo;the hunt&amp;amp;rsquo; and plenty of hunting grounds are available here in Amador County.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
	Two times a year, Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends, bargain hunters can be seen stalking yard sales and sidewalk sales all over the county. Buy &amp;amp;amp; Sell, a weekly ads paper available online, prints on Wednesdays and is the local source for thrifty souls.&#13;
	&amp;amp;lsquo;Trash to Treasures&amp;amp;rsquo; on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend in Sutter Creek is what it says, a search for your personal gems.&#13;
	&amp;amp;lsquo;Dandelion Daze,&amp;amp;rsquo; mid-March, closes Main Street in Jackson for a street fair with bargains galore, music, and food.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Don&amp;amp;rsquo;t miss Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s Main Streets, which has plenty of thrift shops and antique dealers.&#13;

    <Description>Founded in 1856, this Registered Historic Landmark is among the oldest wineries in California. Dedicated to making the finest Zinfandels that express the true character of the vineyard for which it is named. The Sobon family pioneered the planting of Rh&amp;amp;ocirc;ne varietals in the foothills, and all grapes are organically grown. The winery is also the site of the Shenandoah Valley Museum of early agriculture and winemaking and one of the prettiest picnic areas in the county.&#13;

    <Description>The St. George Historic Hotel is located in Volcano-the &amp;amp;ldquo;Gem of the Mother Lode&amp;amp;rdquo;, slightly off the beaten path in the Sierra Nevada Foothills of California.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
While some guests may prefer to stay in the more modern rooms of the annex, the original architecture and ambiance of the main building will offer guests a feeling of serenity and simpler times. Depending on who you talk to, it is rumored that ghosts roam the second and third floor of the hotel, with one room specifically being haunted.&amp;amp;nbsp; The lovely and magical grounds of the St. George are a joy in every season.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The main floor of the St. George Hotel has 3 sections: The &amp;amp;ldquo;Parlor&amp;amp;rdquo; with 12-foot ceilings and a grand fireplace; The &amp;amp;ldquo;Dining Room&amp;amp;rdquo; home to some of the finest food in the County; and The &amp;amp;ldquo;Whiskey Flat Saloon&amp;amp;rdquo; which was added to the main structure in the 1930&amp;amp;rsquo;s and is a great place to have a drink, explore the bar memorabilia on the walls, and meet the locals.&#13;

    <Description>&amp;amp;ldquo;Although John Sutter&amp;amp;rsquo;s sawmill was about forty miles away, Sutter Creek is in the heart of the California Gold Country. Sutter made camp here, trying to avoid the gold rush crowds, but miners soon spilled in and made the town. Mining boomed and then faded&amp;amp;hellip;making way for today&amp;amp;rsquo;s contagion: wine fever.&amp;amp;nbsp;In and around Sutter Creek you can mosey along sidewalks shaded by filigreed balconies. (New York Times 36 Hours: 150 weekends in the US and Canada.) Sutter Creek is 100% walkable. A simple stroll down Main Street leads you to quaint Bed and Breakfast Inns, wine tasting, locally-owned boutiques and galleries, antique stores, Victorian residential neighborhoods and tiny beautiful churches.&#13;

    <Description>Sutter Creek Cottage has 2 bedrooms with luxury mattresses and home-made quilts. It is a short walk--just 2 blocks--from shops, restaurants, and historic buildings. Adjacent to Sutter Creek Cottage is a foot-bridge that crosses Sutter Creek to Minnie Provis Park. Shenandoah Valley, Amador&amp;amp;#39;s wine tasting region, is a short, 10-minute drive away.&#13;
&#13;
Local historic sites of interest include Knight Foundry (across the street), the Monteverde Store (3 blocks away), and Kennedy Mine (about 1 mile away).&#13;
&#13;
Sutter Creek and Amador County is a wonderful place to visit any time of the year. In the Spring, Daffodil Hill is in full bloom and Sutter Creek is at its peak for the annual Duck Race. The warm days of Summer are delightful sipping on wine on the back deck of Sutter Creek Cottage that overlooks the creek that the town is named after. Vintage cars cruise Main Street as music from live bands fills the air. Or go to one of the out door theaters to watch a play. Autumn colors are spectacular and wineries are busy with their Harvest Festivals or attend Sutter Creek&amp;amp;#39;s annual Blues and Brews celebration. The Holiday season finds Sutter Creek celebrating its small town simplicity with parades and Christmas celebrations. In Winter, Kirkwood ski resort is at its peak, and is just 1 hour from Sutter Creek Cottage.&#13;

    <Description>The Sutter Creek Fire Department History Project is restoring and recreating vintage fire equipment used in the Mother Lode for the last 150-plus years.&#13;
&#13;
The Sutter Creek Fire History Projects were started in 2005 by the Sutter Creek Fire District (SCFD) and the Sutter Creek Volunteer Fire Department (SCVFD) to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the Sutter Creek Fire District. The initial project was to research and develop a written/graphic history of the organizations&amp;amp;rsquo; service to Sutter Creek and Amador County.&#13;
&#13;
The SCFD/SCVFD has rebuilt and displayed several pieces of vintage fire fighting equipment. The Amador City 1939 Dodge fire truck has been rehabbed and re-equipped and is on display in the old Amador City firehouse,developed as a fire museum. The first Sutter Creek fire bell has been&amp;amp;nbsp;relocated to the Sutter Creek Main Fire Station and identified with an historic marker.&#13;
&#13;
A Broadsheet History, created in 2006 showcases highlights of the Sutter Creek Fire Department &amp;amp;amp; Fire District history. It is downloadable from this link: http://suttercreekfirehistory.org/projects/broadsheet-history/.&#13;
&#13;
The projects focus on the volunteer aspects of the local fire department organizations that bound the members together, the social aspects of the groups and their service to the community.&#13;
&#13;
The Sutter Creek Fire History Projects research, preserve, recreate and display the local fire and fire department history, and also act as tourist attractions for Sutter Creek and Amador County as a whole. The project focuses on the volunteer aspects of the local fire department organizations that bound the members together, the social aspects of the groups and their service to the community.&#13;

    <Description>Built in 1852, the National Hotel in Jackson, CA was rebuilt after a fire eleven years later. This grand structure was visited thereafter by many kinds of travelers throughout the Great California Gold Rush and then through the turn of two centuries. Thoughtfully renovated with impeccable richness while preserving its historical roots, the National Hotel is a treasure. Original, refinished furniture and artwork grace the lobby, halls and rooms. The hotel anchors downtown Jackson, California, with old-fashioned charm and authentic character. Stanley, the owner,&amp;amp;nbsp; is a living representation of those who built and civilized the wild, wild west; and American Original, his footsteps firmly planted in the great tradition of California adventurers, gamblers, scalawags and dream builders. In a time when America seems to have lost its heroes, lost the American spirit of can do and our tenacity and perseverance through tough times, Stanley Lukowicz has become our call to our better selves. He is, on his own, giving this small slice of the American Pie, Jackson, back their dreams. Come, visit this dream, that became a goal and now is a reality. Each guest room and suite is utterly unique, inspired by the original Victorian decor, while comfortable and elegant. Original furniture has been painstakingly restored, while luxury linens and modern amenities greet each visitor. Elegant en-suite bathrooms include graceful inlaid marble stone heated bath floors. The experience adds up to the best of the old and the convenience of the new. Incredible vistas, clear streams and rivers, gold panning, award-winning wineries, active recreation and the National Hotel in Jackson, CA, it&amp;amp;#39;s a combination that pure gold.&#13;

    <PlaceTags>Volcano</PlaceTags>
    <Description>The town is named for its setting in a bowl-shaped valley which early miners thought was caused by a volcano. The early morning fog rising from the valley floor only reinforced that belief. Barely 130 people live in Volcano today. Volcano was a rip-roaring fold town with more than 5,000 inhabitants. Nearly $100 million was extracted from the area. Because there were many Southern sympathizers during the civil war, a cannon was brought to Volcano to protect outgoing gold shipments to the Union side. It remains on display a few feet where no firing ever happened. Notable firsts for Volcano include: first theater group in the state, California&amp;amp;rsquo;s first debating society, first private school, first law school, and first astronomical observatory. Nearby, Black Chasm Cavern is a National Natural Landmark open year-round.&#13;
&#13;
The landmark St. George Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;

    <Description>Spring is signaled when the bluebirds arrive. These brightly colored birds sometimes raise two groups of young in a season. When the meadowlark sings, summer is on its way. Canada geese can be viewed in our skies and stopping at local ponds and lakes when they make their migration each direction. In the dead of winter, Eagles&amp;amp;#39; nests can be viewed from the water while traveling around Lake Pardee.&#13;
&#13;
Wildlife is part of our daily lives. Most common are the deer, skunks, raccoons, and wild turkeys. Travel on some of the quieter roads, and you may see coyote, bobcat, fox, and an occasional mountain lion. Remember outdoor safety rules while viewing the wildlife. If you are unsure, ask a local ranger at our parks.&#13;

    <Description>Enjoy&amp;amp;nbsp;a step-by-step,&amp;amp;nbsp;hands-on wine blending experience with award-winning winemaker, Corinne Moore.&#13;
&#13;
Come away with a whole new way of appreciating wine tasting &amp;amp;mdash; plus your own custom-blended bottle! Corinne has spent many weeks teaching wine blending classes to ocean-going guests on a Caribbean cruise ship, and brings her wine blending education to you &amp;amp;mdash; at her winery in Amador County. &#13;
&#13;
First, you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll taste a blended wine from the Wine Tree Winery. &#13;
&#13;
Next, you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll taste three wines: Syrah, Grenache and Mourvedre and learn their history and discern their unique characteristics. &#13;
&#13;
Then, you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll mix several different blends to see which you like best.&#13;
&#13;
Everyone has their own preferences, so you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to create a wine that appeals to your own taste. Once you discovered your preferred blend, you can take home a bottle of your very own creation!&#13;
&#13;
Wine Tree Farm offers&amp;amp;nbsp;Wine Blending Class on most Saturday&amp;amp;rsquo;s from 12 pm, and by appointment. We offer private sessions.&#13;
&#13;
Space is limited. $45/person, includes the approximately 2 hour&amp;amp;nbsp;seminar and a take-home bottle of your unique wine blend. &#13;
