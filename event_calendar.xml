    <Name>Reception for Helen Wilkinson</Name>

&#13;
2 to 5 p.m.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Join us at a reception for our featured artist for February, Helen Wilkinson. &#13;
&#13;
Wilkinson said, &amp;amp;quot;My LOVE for glass started in about 1971 when I decided I wanted a Tiffany Style lamp. I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t afford one so I took a 6-week class in stained glass and that was the beginning &amp;amp;mdash; and I haven&amp;amp;#39;t stopped loving glass yet.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&#13;
This versatile artist creates both ornamental and functional pieces. Some are fashioned from stained glass and others from layers of glass fused together, forming patterns or designs depending on colors or other materials used.&amp;amp;nbsp; Her jewelry utilizes crystals, pearls, her lamp-work beads, and colorful fused glass. Helen takes orders for her stained glass wall hangings, sun catchers and automobile designs.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Meet Helen and view her creative and colorful designs.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

This was a killer show last time! High energy, costumes, backup singers, lots of fun!&#13;
&#13;
Since their founding in 2001, Rudy Colombini &amp;amp;amp; The Unauthorized Rolling Stones have brought the excitement, energy, and hits of a live Rolling Stones show to stages across the country. In 2014, founder and frontman Colombini expanded the band by adding all-star members from some of the biggest acts in music, including Kevin Russell (Jersey Boys), Matty Pinder, (son of The Moody Blues&amp;amp;rsquo; Mike Pinder), Ronnie Smith, (Tommy Castro Band), and Sandy Griffith, (Celine Dion, Boz Skaggs, Kenny Loggins). The result has been a quantum leap that has left other Stones tributes in the dust.&#13;
&#13;
Rudy Colombini &amp;amp;amp; The Unauthorized Rolling Stones is a must-see, theatrical rock show! The nine-piece ensemble&amp;amp;rsquo;s pedigree can be traced to some of the biggest acts in the business. Their show holds in reverence many legends of the classic rock years, from Zeppelin to Motown to Dylan, while maintaining their Rolling Stones core. And Colombini&amp;amp;rsquo;s staggering, Jaggeresque showmanship now engages in a battle of the sexes with a trio of seductive, bluesy backup vocali&#13;

A safari in the deepest jungles of the Congo turns deadly when the fiance of one of the most famous wildlife photographers goes missing. As the search party endeavors to find him, one by one, they are murdered.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

Looking for a cozy tea? Well, it is not here.&#13;
&#13;
Our Afternoon Tea Mysteries are far from being threatening (we hope!) but this is not your ordinary teatime of red hats and extended pinkies, discussing the posies in the garden. In fact, it is very possible there is a body buried in the garden . . . under the posies. Guests at the Tea come in character.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The characters mingle. The perpetrator is unearthed.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
And the stellar sleuth is applauded!&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

Linda French of Possibili-Teas provides the Mystery;&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Jackie Tarchala of Kneading Dough Bakery provides the afternoon tea;&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
and Linda Hein of Baker Street West provides the backdrop.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

Adrian Brannan, aka Adrian Buckaroogirl, will take her listeners deep into the lives and challenges faced by cowboys and ranchers through songs that reflect her experiences growing up on ranches throughout the west when she takes the stage at the Friends of the Amador County Library&amp;amp;rsquo;s 7th Annual Boots &amp;amp;rsquo;n&amp;amp;rsquo; Books Concert.&#13;
&#13;
Adrian was listed by Cowboys and Indians Magazine in its Next West highlights as one of the &amp;amp;ldquo;. . . 20 bright young stars of the Western world . . .&amp;amp;rdquo; She is an exuberant, dynamic, talented, singer/songwriter with an infectious, positive attitude and a powerful voice. Adrian is equally at home in the branding pen roping calves or on stage in front of thousands of fans.&#13;
&#13;
Adrian&amp;amp;rsquo;s second CD, Boots and Pearls, was produced by noted singer/songwriter Tom Russell who said in The Cowboy Way Magazine, &amp;amp;ldquo;I heard the clear potential. I was impressed that she has such a great voice and was so at ease on stage . . . Adrian is the breath of strong fresh air that the cowboy music scene needs. I was honored to have worked with her.&amp;amp;rdquo; The title cut from Boots and Pearls has spawned a nationwide tide of theme weddings from women who identify with Adrian&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to be a feminine, yet working cowgirl.&#13;
&#13;
Amador County personality Ed Tracey will emcee the event.&#13;
&#13;
A silent auction and raffle will feature prizes including vacation getaways, wine, dinners, theater tickets and gift certificates from a variety of contributors. Refreshments will be served.&#13;
&#13;
Tickets are $20 in advance and $25 at the door (if available).&#13;
&#13;
Tickets are available at: Hein &amp;amp;amp; Company Bookstore, 204 Main Street, Jackson, Mother Lode Music, 11310 Prospect Dr. Ste. 80, Jackson&#13;

This unique collaborative effort between two uniquely gifted musicians is bound to be a revelation to traditional music fans on several counts. Rob Ickes is a longtime, well-established instrumental giant, and Trey Hensley is newly arrived in Music City, bursting with talent both as a vocalist and guitarist. Their new album, Before the Sun Goes Down, is slated for release this winter.&#13;
&#13;
From his powerful yet sympathetic vocal interpretations of traditional and contemporary material to his jaw-dropping instrumental skills on both acoustic and electric guitar and considerable songwriting talents, Trey Hensley is bursting at the seams with freshness and musical excitement. His resonant baritone voice is rich, expressive, and equally at ease with classic bluegrass, traditional country, and original compositions. Raised in Jonesborough, Tennessee, Trey began playing guitar and singing when he was 10 years old. Invited by Marty Stuart and joined from the wings by Earl Scruggs, Trey Hensley landed on the Grand Old Opry when he was only 11.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

When thinking of France, the first images that may come to mind are the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe. All are absolutely stunning in their own right, but there are other treasures in France to fall in love with -- the wine and cuisine of Burgundy!&#13;
&#13;
What makes this one-of-a-kind region so special? The wine and food are completely influenced by unique terroir, culture, landscape, and history. Join us at Taste Restaurant and Wine bar for a night of culinary exploration of Burgundy, one of the most celebrated wine regions in the world.&#13;

First Weekend in March&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Fans of Amador County wines will not be fed a steady diet of Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot and other &amp;amp;lsquo;mainstream&amp;amp;rsquo; varieties when they visit the historic region&amp;amp;rsquo;s charming small family wineries. Instead, you will be treated to a cornucopia of old-vine zinfandels, syrahs, sangioveses, barberas, viogniers and other &amp;amp;lsquo;off-the-beaten-track&amp;amp;rsquo;, which flourish in Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s sun-bathed hillside vineyards. These delicious, food-friendly wines will be showcased at the Amador Vintners&amp;amp;rsquo; annual &amp;amp;ldquo;Behind the Cellar Door&amp;amp;rdquo; weekend wine extravaganza.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The event features tastings from barrel and bottle at 39 Amador County wineries, along with a diverse array of entertainment, demonstrations, tours and seminars. Library and vertical tastings, live music, gourmet foods, numerous winemaker dinners and perhaps Sunday brunch fill out the weekend&amp;amp;rsquo;s festivities.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Presale tickets are available for both days, Sunday only and reduced price for designated driver. Tickets will be available at participating wineries during the event. *Must be 21 or older to purchase.&#13;

First Weekend in March&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Fans of Amador County wines will not be fed a steady diet of Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot and other &amp;amp;lsquo;mainstream&amp;amp;rsquo; varieties when they visit the historic region&amp;amp;rsquo;s charming small family wineries. Instead, you will be treated to a cornucopia of old-vine zinfandels, syrahs, sangioveses, barberas, viogniers and other &amp;amp;lsquo;off-the-beaten-track&amp;amp;rsquo;, which flourish in Amador&amp;amp;rsquo;s sun-bathed hillside vineyards. These delicious, food-friendly wines will be showcased at the Amador Vintners&amp;amp;rsquo; annual &amp;amp;ldquo;Behind the Cellar Door&amp;amp;rdquo; weekend wine extravaganza.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The event features tastings from barrel and bottle at 39 Amador County wineries, along with a diverse array of entertainment, demonstrations, tours and seminars. Library and vertical tastings, live music, gourmet foods, numerous winemaker dinners and perhaps Sunday brunch fill out the weekend&amp;amp;rsquo;s festivities.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Presale tickets are available for both days, Sunday only and reduced price for designated driver. Tickets will be available at participating wineries during the event. *Must be 21 or older to purchase.&#13;

Come to Ione and enjoy an informative historical tour of the magnificent Preston Castle and surrounding grounds.&amp;amp;nbsp; The strikingly beautiful Romanesque style Preston Castle, on a hill in Ione, was actually the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, the first major attempt in California at rehabilitating, instead of just imprisoning, young offenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Opened in 1894, the Preston School of Industry became a leader in the juvenile prison reform movement by giving convicted boys a real chance at life by educating them not only in academics, but in all of the useful trades of the time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Closed in 1960, when the Preston Youth Authority moved into a new administration building down the hill, the Preston Castle was left to deteriorate due to weather, vandalism, and general neglect.&amp;amp;nbsp; It now serves as a vacant, but vitally important landmark for Ione, Amador County, and the Mother lode.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a California State Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Also available is a Virtual Tour for our mobility-restricted guests which will take place on the accessible ground floor (basement) of the Castle.&#13;

Just what is Ladies Night? It is Sutter Creek&amp;amp;rsquo;s way of saying &amp;amp;ldquo;Thank You&amp;amp;rdquo; for supporting them throughout the year. It is the merchants way of giving back to their customers (and future customers), with the opportunity to win FREE merchandise from all their wonderful stores and see what&amp;amp;rsquo;s new.&#13;

&#13;
What do you do for Ladies Night? Well, approximately 20 stores stay open late for you to visit. You will be welcomed with appetizers, great sales, and warm receptions from these wonderful stores. Inside each participating store you will fill out a raffle ticket and place it in the designated raffle bag to enter the FREE DRAWING for merchandise from their stores. If you happen to purchase something from that store, you will be given a SECOND raffle ticket to fill out for their drawing.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
How do you win? At the end of the evening you will gather at the beautiful Hotel Sutter at 8:30 for the Grand Raffle Drawing.&amp;amp;nbsp; Each bag from each store will have a raffle ticket drawn to give away the prize from that store. All in all, over $1,000 in merchandise will be given away! Winners must be present to win.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Don&amp;amp;rsquo;t miss this Ladies (and Gentlemens) Night. Start at any participating store and be sure to end up at the Hotel Sutter by 8:30 for the final Raffle Drawing.

Every Saturday and Sunday,&amp;amp;nbsp; April 1, 2017 through September 10, 2017&#13;

&#13;
Tours start at 10 am. Last guided tour starts 1:00pm&#13;

&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Come to Ione and enjoy an informative historical tour of the magnificent Preston Castle and surrounding grounds.&amp;amp;nbsp; The strikingly beautiful Romanesque style Preston Castle, on a hill in Ione, was actually the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, the first major attempt in California at rehabilitating, instead of just imprisoning, young offenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Opened in 1894, the Preston School of Industry became a leader in the juvenile prison reform movement by giving convicted boys a real chance at life by educating them not only in academics, but in all of the useful trades of the time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Closed in 1960, when the Preston Youth Authority moved into a new administration building down the hill, the Preston Castle was left to deteriorate due to weather, vandalism, and general neglect.&amp;amp;nbsp; It now serves as a vacant, but vitally important landmark for Ione, Amador County, and the Motherlode.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a California State Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
Also available is a Virtual Tour for our mobility-restricted guests which will take place on the accessible ground floor (basement) of the Castle.&#13;
&#13;
Guided tours - $15, age 12 and under $12&#13;
&#13;
Virtual tours - $10, 12 and under $5&#13;
&#13;
All tours for under 5 years, free&#13;

    <Name>Sierra Century Ride</Name>
    <Body>Saturday, April 15th,&#13;
&#13;
Check-In: 6-9am&#13;
&#13;
Start Time:&amp;amp;nbsp;7am&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Sacramento Wheelmen&amp;amp;#39;s Sierra Century Slug Gulch invites you to choose an adventure from among 5 different routes through the beautiful rolling oak woodland and pine forests of Amador and El Dorado Counties, including the wine regions of Fair Play and Shenandoah Valley and historic Gold Rush towns of Ione, Sutter Creek, Volcano, Fiddletown, Mt. Aukum and Slug Gulch.&#13;
Some of these routes are adventures because this largely undeveloped county is highly scenic and uniquely historic, the roads are in good condition with little and often no traffic, and the available routes have a wide variety of terrain. All of the routes have significant climbing.&amp;amp;nbsp; If you are looking for routes that are flat or mostly flat, this event is not for you. All routes begin and end at the Amador County Fairgrounds.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
All routes are fully supported by rest and water stops, SAG vehicles with HAM radio communication, bicycle mechanics, flaggers, law enforcement personnel and a large corps of volunteers&#13;
&#13;

Schedule for&amp;amp;nbsp; public tours&#13;
&#13;
Every Saturday and Sunday,&amp;amp;nbsp; April 1, 2017 through September 10, 2017&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tours start at 10 am. Last guided tour starts 1:00pm&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Come to Ione and enjoy an informative historical tour of the magnificent Preston Castle and surrounding grounds.&amp;amp;nbsp; The strikingly beautiful Romanesque style Preston Castle, on a hill in Ione, was actually the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, the first major attempt in California at rehabilitating, instead of just imprisoning, young offenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Opened in 1894, the Preston School of Industry became a leader in the juvenile prison reform movement by giving convicted boys a real chance at life by educating them not only in academics, but in all of the useful trades of the time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Closed in 1960, when the Preston Youth Authority moved into a new administration building down the hill, the Preston Castle was left to deteriorate due to weather, vandalism, and general neglect.&amp;amp;nbsp; It now serves as a vacant, but vitally important landmark for Ione, Amador County, and the Motherlode.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a California State Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
Also available is a Virtual Tour for our mobility-restricted guests which will take place on the accessible ground floor (basement) of the Castle.&#13;
&#13;
Guided tours - $15, age 12 and under $12&#13;
&#13;
Virtual tours - $10, 12 and under $5&#13;
&#13;
All tours for under 5 years, free&#13;

Our Spring Book Sales enable us to help the library as they need money for subscriptions, new computers, systems for DVD storage, children&amp;amp;#39;s story time and the summer reading program, Little Libraries, adding to the general collection and lots more. We are fortunate to live in a community with so many people who are generous with their donations and time. The book sale takes five days to assemble, host and disassemble, but it has become a labor of love. It is so wonderful to work with all of the enthusiastic, competent volunteers.&#13;

&#13;
Come to Ione and enjoy an informative historical tour of the magnificent Preston Castle and surrounding grounds.&amp;amp;nbsp; The strikingly beautiful Romanesque style Preston Castle, on a hill in Ione, was actually the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, the first major attempt in California at rehabilitating, instead of just imprisoning, young offenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Opened in 1894, the Preston School of Industry became a leader in the juvenile prison reform movement by giving convicted boys a real chance at life by educating them not only in academics, but in all of the useful trades of the time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Closed in 1960, when the Preston Youth Authority moved into a new administration building down the hill, the Preston Castle was left to deteriorate due to weather, vandalism, and general neglect.&amp;amp;nbsp; It now serves as a vacant, but vitally important landmark for Ione, Amador County, and the Motherlode.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a California State Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
Also available is a Virtual Tour for our mobility-restricted guests which will take place on the accessible ground floor (basement) of the Castle.&#13;
&#13;
Guided tours - $15, age 12 and under $12&#13;
&#13;
Virtual tours - $10, 12 and under $5&#13;
&#13;
All tours for under 5 years, free&#13;

Schedule for&amp;amp;nbsp; public tours&#13;
&#13;
Every Saturday and Sunday,&amp;amp;nbsp; April 1, 2017 through September 10, 2017&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tours start at 10 am. Last guided tour starts 1:00pm&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Come to Ione and enjoy an informative historical tour of the magnificent Preston Castle and surrounding grounds.&amp;amp;nbsp; The strikingly beautiful Romanesque style Preston Castle, on a hill in Ione, was actually the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, the first major attempt in California at rehabilitating, instead of just imprisoning, young offenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Opened in 1894, the Preston School of Industry became a leader in the juvenile prison reform movement by giving convicted boys a real chance at life by educating them not only in academics, but in all of the useful trades of the time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Closed in 1960, when the Preston Youth Authority moved into a new administration building down the hill, the Preston Castle was left to deteriorate due to weather, vandalism, and general neglect.&amp;amp;nbsp; It now serves as a vacant, but vitally important landmark for Ione, Amador County, and the Motherlode.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a California State Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
Also available is a Virtual Tour for our mobility-restricted guests which will take place on the accessible ground floor (basement) of the Castle.&#13;
&#13;
Guided tours - $15, age 12 and under $12&#13;
&#13;
Virtual tours - $10, 12 and under $5&#13;
&#13;

    <Name>Art Garfunkel in Concert</Name>
    <Body>Friday&#13;
&#13;
May 12, 2017&#13;
&#13;
Concert Starts 7 p.m.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Jackson Rancheria Casino Resort welcomes Art Garfunkel to the Grand Oak Ballroom stage.&#13;
&#13;
Art Garfunkel was originally revered for his Grammy-winning, chart-topping songs and albums with partner and fellow NYC native Paul Simon. &amp;amp;nbsp;Their greatest hits collection, which includes &amp;amp;ldquo;Mrs. Robinson,&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ldquo;Scarborough Fair,&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ldquo;The Sound of Silence,&amp;amp;rdquo; &amp;amp;ldquo;The Boxer&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&amp;amp;rdquo; among others.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;After Simon &amp;amp;amp; Garfunkel parted ways in 1970, Garfunkel landed several major film roles, including Carnal Knowledge (opposite Jack Nicholson), Catch 22 and Nicholas Roeg&amp;amp;rsquo;s Bad Timing/A Sensual Obsession. His solo debut Angel Clare spawned the top 10 hit &amp;amp;ldquo;All I Know.&amp;amp;rdquo; The 80s and 90s found Garfunkel doing what he does best: singing for an audience. &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ldquo;Taking on the fear and vulnerability of a live show keeps you vital,&amp;amp;rdquo; says Garfunkel, who relishes the opportunity to perform new and classic material for fans around the world. &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ldquo;I&amp;amp;rsquo;m a singer trying to get away with a lucky job. I try to soothe, to lift...That&amp;amp;rsquo;s my life.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#13;
&#13;
Will Call opens at 5 p.m., doors open at 6 p.m. and the show begins at 7 p.m. Beer, food, and wine will be available for purchase.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

3 to 5pm&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
A free community event with complimentary refreshments will be happening.It&amp;amp;rsquo;s the annual AmadorArts Student Arts Showcase, the time to view a wildly creative cross-section of art created by local elementary school students.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
On Thursday, the showcase will coincide with the May AmadorArts Arts Networking Mixer. The Heart and Soul Studio at 21 Badger Street in Sutter Creek will be the place, and AmadorArts will be the hosts and organizers of the Student Arts Showcase.&#13;
&#13;
Each year AmadorArts brings in-depth standards-based instruction by&amp;amp;nbsp;professional artists into all of our local elementary schools. In the 2015-2016 school year, a total of 1,450 students will have participated in arts classes&amp;amp;nbsp;facilitated by the non-profit organization. Classes included: 1st grade Color Wheel, 2nd grade Doodle Art, 3rd grade Matisse-inspired Paper Collage, 4th grade Watercolor Technique and 5th grade Chalk Pastel.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Arts education not only enhances students&amp;amp;#39; understanding of the world around them, but it also gives them a sense of emotional satisfaction when they are involved in making art. They have control over the materials they use, making decisions about form, color, etc. &amp;amp;nbsp;And, it brings joy.&#13;
&#13;
So, come see the students&amp;amp;rsquo; art that is the result of these programs. Be amazed by our youth&amp;amp;rsquo;s creativity!&amp;amp;nbsp; The Chair of the California Arts Council confirms the idea: &amp;amp;ldquo;It is always exciting to see what creative minds attempt to do when being guided by professional working artists.&amp;amp;rdquo;&#13;

THE ROUNDHOUSE (HUN&amp;amp;rsquo;GE)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For the Northern Sierra Miwok who settled in this area centuries ago, the Roundhouse (or Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ge) was the true center of ceremonial and social life.&#13;
&#13;
In 2013 the Jackson Rancheria Band of Miwuk Indians, along with neighboring Miwok tribes, began the once-in-a-generation rebuilding the Ceremonial Roundhouse (or Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ge) at Chaw&amp;amp;rsquo;se Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park.&#13;
&#13;
The sacred process and traditions of deconstruction and rebuilding utilized traditional materials and construction techniques, and was completed in September of 2015.&amp;amp;nbsp; Every element of the Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ges architecture contains spiritual significance, and the Roundhouse continues to be used by today&amp;amp;rsquo;s local tribes for private ceremonies.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
ROUNDHOUSE ETIQUETTE&#13;

THE ROUNDHOUSE (HUN&amp;amp;rsquo;GE)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For the Northern Sierra Miwok who settled in this area centuries ago, the Roundhouse (or Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ge) was the true center of ceremonial and social life.&#13;
&#13;
In 2013 the Jackson Rancheria Band of Miwuk Indians, along with neighboring Miwok tribes, began the once-in-a-generation rebuilding the Ceremonial Roundhouse (or Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ge) at Chaw&amp;amp;rsquo;se Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park.&#13;
&#13;
The sacred process and traditions of deconstruction and rebuilding utilized traditional materials and construction techniques, and was completed in September of 2015.&amp;amp;nbsp; Every element of the Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ges architecture contains spiritual significance, and the Roundhouse continues to be used by today&amp;amp;rsquo;s local tribes for private ceremonies.&#13;

We cordially invite you to join us in celebrating the ITALIAN PICNIC PARADE.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Looking down Old State Highway 49, you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll see raised sidewalks flanking the two-lane road, with spectators&amp;amp;nbsp;claiming spots along the Grand Parade route. A lucky few have seats on turn-of-the-century-style balconies, with bird&amp;amp;rsquo;s-eye views of giant colored balloons, trays of snow cones, and clowns bent on selling the necessary parade accoutrements &amp;amp;ndash; long horns, flags, water guns, cotton candy.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Most of the county residents who haven&amp;amp;rsquo;t staked out sideline positions seem to be involved in the parade &amp;amp;ndash; on a float, in a band, as a member of a marching Boy Scout, Girl Scout, or 4-H unit, riding high on county fire equipment, or dressed to the hilt on a horse. You can be part of the action yourself if you jump into your car and follow the pooper-scoopers behind the parade up the hill about 1 mile to the Italian Picnic grounds for more fun, food, music and Italian culture.&#13;
&#13;

Scotland is coming to Amador County with the inaugural Mother Lode Highland Games and Gathering. This two-day event is great for the whole family, from the young to the young at heart.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Highland Games will have events such as caber tossing (throwing what looks like a wooden telephone pole one end over the other), putting the stone (similar to shot put but with an irregular-shaped, 16-pound stone), weight for distance (a 56 pound weight thrown with one hand while keeping the feet within a very small area) and tossing the sheaf (picking up a bundle of straw with a pitchfork and tossing it over a bar). Carl McDanel, Chief of the Mother Lode Scots, says the games are fashioned after those believed to have taken place during ancient times to help chieftains in the highlands of Scotland find the strongest men for their armies. The Games are played by competitive men and women from around the nation and from other countries.&#13;
&#13;
If you are wanting to find your roots you can visit the Clan Village where many clans will be available to assist in that search. They will have books and information on the various clans.&#13;
&#13;
For the kids there will be a Children&amp;amp;#39;s Glen with their own games, such as potato sack races, tug-of-war contests, they can even throw a mini caber. A children&amp;amp;#39;s tent will have crafts for the kids and other fun things to do throughout the day.&#13;
&#13;
During this weekend event one can hear Scottish music, bagpipes and entertainment.&#13;
&#13;
For the animal lovers there will be Miniature Highland Cattle (or Coos as they&amp;amp;#39;re called in Scotland), Sheep Dog Demonstrations along with other animal displays and demonstrations. In the dog arena there will be deer hounds, border collies, along with several other breeds.&#13;
&#13;
Along with the competitive games and music, animals, and children&amp;amp;#39;s activities there will also be a classic car show.&#13;
&#13;
For those who have never tried Scottish foods come on out. In our food court there will be fish and chips, pasties, meat pies and of course haggis (the Americanized version which is a &amp;amp;ldquo;sausage of meat and oats along with some spices). The Games will have a number of Scottish food vendors along with other foods as well.&#13;
&#13;
And for those of you who like to shop you can visit the Village Marketplace where you will find 30 plus craft vendors, kilt makers/dealers, Scottish and Irish candies along with English Toffee, glassware, clothing, imports and much, much more.&#13;
&#13;
Since Amador County is rich in viticulture the Games will offer wine seminars throughout the weekend. These wine tasting seminars will provide you with a greater understanding of the Shenandoah Valley and Fiddletown Appellations, characteristics of various varietals, wine styles along with much more.&#13;
&#13;
Scotland with it&amp;amp;#39;s long history in the distillation of Scotch (or malt as its called in Scotland) will offer whisky tasting seminars. These seminars will provide you with a greater understanding of the history of whisky, it&amp;amp;#39;s distillation process and the various characteristics of whisky varieties.&#13;
&#13;
Last, but not least, will be the Living History Village where you may run into anyone from Mary Queen of Scot to weavers and craftsmen to Mountain Men. In the Living History Village one can also pan for gold, view the ore crusher and watch lumber being cut on the Gold Rush Era Sawmill.&#13;

Vino Noceto&amp;amp;#39;s Farm-to-Glass Tour Program provides the perfect platform for us to intimately share our passion for agriculture and winemaking with our guests.&#13;
&#13;
This fun and informative tour program follows the path of our estate grapes from the vineyard to the cellar to the bottle, and provides a snapshot of current vineyard &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;nbsp;winery activities. Come as often as you like -- the winery and vineyard are in constant flux.&#13;
&#13;
Owner Jim Gullett shares,&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;ldquo;Vino Noceto strives to maintain a strong link between its grapes in the vineyard and the wine that we produce. By walking through the vineyard we hope to introduce people to some of the myriad of factors that impact how we choose grapes, and additionally how we try to use coax flavors from these grapes to produce several distinct Sangiovese wines--ranging from fairly Italian to very Californian.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&#13;
Each tour begins with a short trek through our vineyard from the tasting room to the winery, including visits to the fermentation room, barrel room and crush pad. Along the way through the winery and vineyard you will try six different Vino Noceto wines with one of our wine education specialists.&#13;
&#13;
Please wear comfortable (preferrably closed-toe) shoes.&#13;

Vino Noceto&amp;amp;#39;s Farm-to-Glass Tour Program provides the perfect platform for us to intimately share our passion for agriculture and winemaking with our guests.&#13;
&#13;
This fun and informative tour program follows the path of our estate grapes from the vineyard to the cellar to the bottle, and provides a snapshot of current vineyard &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;nbsp;winery activities. Come as often as you like -- the winery and vineyard are in constant flux.&#13;
&#13;
Owner Jim Gullett shares,&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;ldquo;Vino Noceto strives to maintain a strong link between its grapes in the vineyard and the wine that we produce. By walking through the vineyard we hope to introduce people to some of the myriad of factors that impact how we choose grapes, and additionally how we try to use coax flavors from these grapes to produce several distinct Sangiovese wines--ranging from fairly Italian to very Californian.&amp;amp;quot;&#13;
&#13;
Each tour begins with a short trek through our vineyard from the tasting room to the winery, including visits to the fermentation room, barrel room and crush pad. Along the way through the winery and vineyard you will try six different Vino Noceto wines with one of our wine education specialists.&#13;
&#13;
Please wear comfortable (preferrably closed-toe) shoes.&#13;

&#13;
Come to Ione and enjoy an informative historical tour of the magnificent Preston Castle and surrounding grounds.&amp;amp;nbsp; The strikingly beautiful Romanesque style Preston Castle, on a hill in Ione, was actually the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, the first major attempt in California at rehabilitating, instead of just imprisoning, young offenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Opened in 1894, the Preston School of Industry became a leader in the juvenile prison reform movement by giving convicted boys a real chance at life by educating them not only in academics, but in all of the useful trades of the time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Closed in 1960, when the Preston Youth Authority moved into a new administration building down the hill, the Preston Castle was left to deteriorate due to weather, vandalism, and general neglect.&amp;amp;nbsp; It now serves as a vacant, but vitally important landmark for Ione, Amador County, and the Motherlode.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a California State Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
Also available is a Virtual Tour for our mobility-restricted guests which will take place on the accessible ground floor (basement) of the Castle.&#13;
&#13;
Guided tours - $15, age 12 and under $12&#13;

February 2016&#13;
&#13;
It is true that one man&amp;amp;rsquo;s trash can be another man&amp;amp;rsquo;s treasure, especially at this year&amp;amp;rsquo;s Fiddletown Flea. This annual flea market boasts several locations in and around Fiddletown, plus a caf&amp;amp;eacute; in the Fiddletown Community Center with food, drinks and souvenirs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This year&amp;amp;rsquo;s event will have vendors in the park, many residential locations and, vendors in the community hall as well. Also, this year part of the community hall will be turned into a caf&amp;amp;eacute; with food, beverages and souvenirs including Fiddletown T-shirts, hats, postcards and bumper stickers available for purchase. &#13;
&#13;
This event is an opportunity for all the local organizations, The Fiddletown Community Center, The Fiddletown Preservation Society, The Moose Lodge, Fiddletown Community Church and the residents to join together, enjoy the fun and do a little fundraising says Florence Chilton, founder of the Flea. Out of town visitors will enjoy roaming the hills around Fiddletown, visiting with the sellers, finding unusual items and getting a peek into a lifestyle different from their own. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s also an opportunity to view some really special gardens. Always hot on the item list are antiques. You never know what someone may find in their barn that they no longer have a use for. Cast iron cookware, tools and lots of miscellaneous. &#13;
&#13;
This ninth annual event was started by Chilton after moving to Fiddletown in 2001. While unpacking boxes, Chilton realized she had too much stuff. She thought about having a yard sale, but quickly remembered how far out of town they now were and that they would probably not get much traffic, she said. After talking with several of her neighbors, she found that they had the same complaint. When she suggested that they hold a sale at the local park, one neighbor commented that they had too much stuff to haul to the park. That is when Chilton came up with the idea for the Fiddletown Flea, a combination event for those that wanted to be at the park and those who wanted to participate at home. The Fiddletown Community Center sent out applications with a great response.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;ldquo;Our first year we had seven vendors in the park and six remote locations,&amp;amp;rdquo; Chilton said. &amp;amp;ldquo;It turned into a giant scavenger hunt.&amp;amp;nbsp; Several of the remote locations were old family farms that had just incredible stuff collected for generations. Also, several of the locations had plants for sale for really good prices.&amp;amp;quot; Because locations varied from the park to around town, Chilton tries to keep the number of remote locations limited to 12 to 14 so all are easily visited.&amp;amp;nbsp; &#13;
&#13;
The event has always been well attended. Cost for a booth at the park or a listing on the map is $20. Anyone with questions may call Chilton at 209-296-0918. Maps with detailed directions to the all locations will be handed out at the park and several of the homes. Chilton&amp;amp;rsquo;s favorite part of the event &amp;amp;ldquo;is the shopping of course,&amp;amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;amp;ldquo;I do have a slight advantage as I go out to each of the sites the day before to place signage, I get a sneak preview.&amp;amp;quot; Early Saturday morning I again visit each site to make sure everyone is ready &amp;amp;ndash; that is when the bartering begins and the real fun starts.&amp;amp;rdquo; After the shopping is done and lunch is over, a quick trip over the hill is in order. That is where the Shanendoah Valley is located. With many beautiful wineries serving award winning wines, it is a lovely way to end a day in the Amador foothills. -&amp;amp;nbsp; FleaMarkets.in/Fiddletown/California&#13;

Scotland is coming to Amador County with the inaugural Mother Lode Highland Games and Gathering. This two-day event is great for the whole family, from the young to the young at heart.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Highland Games will have events such as caber tossing (throwing what looks like a wooden telephone pole one end over the other), putting the stone (similar to shot put but with an irregular-shaped, 16-pound stone), weight for distance (a 56 pound weight thrown with one hand while keeping the feet within a very small area) and tossing the sheaf (picking up a bundle of straw with a pitchfork and tossing it over a bar).&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Carl McDanel, Chief of the Mother Lode Scots, says the games are fashioned after those believed to have taken place during ancient times to help chieftains in the highlands of Scotland find the strongest men for their armies. The Games are played by competitive men and women from around the nation and from other countries.&#13;
&#13;
If you are wanting to find your roots you can visit the Clan Village where many clans will be available to assist in that search. They will have books and information on the various clans.&#13;
&#13;
For the kids there will be a Children&amp;amp;#39;s Glen with their own games, such as potato sack races, tug-of-war contests, they can even throw a mini caber. A children&amp;amp;#39;s tent will have crafts for the kids and other fun things to do throughout the day.&#13;
&#13;
During this weekend event one can hear Scottish music, bagpipes and entertainment. The lineup of entertainers is The AnGry Brians, Black Irish, Golden Bough, Cooking With Turf, Michael Mullen a Trio of One, and Tempest. These bands will perform at the various stages and venues throughout the fairgrounds.&#13;
&#13;
For the animal lovers there will be Miniature Highland Cattle (or Coos as they&amp;amp;#39;re called in Scotland), Sheep Dog Demonstrations along with other animal displays and demonstrations. In the dog arena there will be deer hounds, border collies, along with several other breeds.&#13;
&#13;
Along with the competitive games and music, animals, and children&amp;amp;#39;s activities there will also be a classic car show.&#13;
&#13;
For those who have never tried Scottish foods come on out. In our food court there will be fish and chips, pasties, meat pies and of course haggis (the Americanized version which is a &amp;amp;ldquo;sausage of meat and oats along with some spices). The Games will have a number of Scottish food vendors along with other foods as well.&#13;
&#13;
And for those of you who like to shop you can visit the Village Marketplace where you will find 30 plus craft vendors, kilt makers/dealers, Scottish and Irish candies along with English Toffee, glassware, clothing, imports and much, much more.&#13;
&#13;
Since Amador County is rich in viticulture the Games will offer wine seminars throughout the weekend. These wine tasting seminars will provide you with a greater understanding of the Shenandoah Valley and Fiddletown Appellations, characteristics of various varietals, wine styles along with much more.&#13;
&#13;
Scotland with it&amp;amp;#39;s long history in the distillation of Scotch (or malt as its called in Scotland) will offer whisky tasting seminars. These seminars will provide you with a greater understanding of the history of whisky, it&amp;amp;#39;s distillation process and the various characteristics of whisky varieties.&#13;
&#13;
Last, but not least, will be the Living History Village where you may run into anyone from Mary Queen of Scot to weavers and craftsmen to Mountain Men. In the Living History Village one can also pan for gold, view the ore crusher and watch lumber being cut on the Gold Rush Era Sawmill.&#13;

Willow Springs Restoration Fundraiser- a community sale &amp;amp;amp; flea market to support restoration of the school building.&#13;
&#13;

From the beginning, the school house and out buildings were installed and maintained by members of the local community. When the school closed in June 1955, the school house and grounds became a community center and continues to be maintained by the Willow Springs Community Club and was used for local functions. It has always been a local gathering place for people of all ages and is equipped for multiple uses.&#13;

Stop by to and find favorite treasure or a delightful surprise you didn&amp;amp;#39;t know you had to have! Help us maintain our historic gathering place.&#13;

Come to Ione and enjoy an informative historical tour of the magnificent Preston Castle and surrounding grounds.&amp;amp;nbsp; The strikingly beautiful Romanesque style Preston Castle, on a hill in Ione, was actually the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, the first major attempt in California at rehabilitating, instead of just imprisoning, young offenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Opened in 1894, the Preston School of Industry became a leader in the juvenile prison reform movement by giving convicted boys a real chance at life by educating them not only in academics, but in all of the useful trades of the time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Closed in 1960, when the Preston Youth Authority moved into a new administration building down the hill, the Preston Castle was left to deteriorate due to weather, vandalism, and general neglect.&amp;amp;nbsp; It now serves as a vacant, but vitally important landmark for Ione, Amador County, and the Mother lode.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a California State Historic Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Also available is a Virtual Tour for our mobility-restricted guests which will take place on the accessible ground floor (basement) of the Castle.&#13;

    <Name>Oktoberfest of the Gold Country</Name>
    <Body>3rd Saturday in September&#13;

1:00PM-8:00PM&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Willkommen in the Gold Country! Dust off your dirndl and lederhosen and come join the fun at the Jackson Oktoberfest on the third&amp;amp;nbsp;Saturday of September. Oktoberfest promises fun for the entire family, including live entertainment, contests, music and dancing, and an authentic taste of Bavaria with Wolfgang&amp;amp;#39;s soft pretzels, and of course, the mainstay of any Oktoberfest...German beer!&#13;
&#13;
Jackson Oktoberfest was founded by Wolfgang&amp;amp;#39;s Pretzels of Pioneer, California in 2012. Wolfgang wanted to share his German heritage with the community, while raising some money for local charities. The event will be held at the Italian Picnic Grounds in Sutter Creek, which has been aptly dubbed &amp;amp;quot;Oktoberfest Picnic Grounds&amp;amp;quot; for the day, so there&amp;amp;#39;s plenty of room for everyone!&#13;
&#13;
Beer aficionados will experience the taste of authentic German Oktoberfest beer without going across the pond. Delight in the flavors of Original Hofbrau Oktoberfest brew, along with several other Hofbrau beer selections. Wine, soft drinks and water will also be available.&#13;
&#13;
Adding to the fun, will be a showcase of authentic oompah, polka, and waltzing music, and Bavarian Country &amp;amp;amp; Folklore dances. So put on your dancing shoes and brush up on your &amp;amp;ldquo;Chicken Dance&amp;amp;rdquo;!&#13;
&#13;
Of course the best of any Oktoberfest celebration is the hearty menu of delicious German foods. Menu items include Bratwurst &amp;amp;amp; Sauerkraut, smoked pork chops &amp;amp;amp; Sauerkraut, Wolfgang&amp;amp;#39;s authentic Bavarian Soft Pretzels, apple strudel, and vanilla battered apple rings!&#13;
&#13;
Adding to the excitement are traditional contests with plenty of prizes. Try your hand at Keg Rolling, Yodeling, Bratwurst Throwing, or see how many mugs you can hold in one hand!&#13;
&#13;
To add to the fun, everyone is encouraged to dress in traditional German attire, however costume is not required. All are welcome&amp;amp;hellip;costume or not!&#13;
&#13;
Pre-sale tickets are just $25 for a custom collector&amp;amp;#39;s beer glass or wine glass with one drink, and entertainment.&#13;
&#13;
Youth ages 6 &amp;amp;ndash; 20 are $12 including a soda and entertainment. Children under 6 are free.&#13;
&#13;
VIP Dinner packages are available for $38 and include reserved seating, a custom collector&amp;amp;#39;s beer glass or wine glass with one drink, your choice of pork chop or two bratwurst, sauerkraut and/or red cabbage &amp;amp;amp; pretzel dinner, and entertainment. A VIP table of 8 is just $280.&#13;
&#13;
Jackson Oktoberfest is hosted by Wolfgang&amp;amp;rsquo;s Bavarian Pretzels. It is a for profit event with a portion of the proceeds to benefit local charities.&#13;

THE ROUNDHOUSE (HUN&amp;amp;rsquo;GE)&#13;
&#13;
For the Northern Sierra Miwok who settled in this area centuries ago, the Roundhouse (or Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ge) was the true center of ceremonial and social life.&#13;
&#13;
In 2013 the Jackson Rancheria Band of Miwuk Indians, along with neighboring Miwok tribes, began the once-in-a-generation rebuilding the Ceremonial Roundhouse (or Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ge) at Chaw&amp;amp;rsquo;se Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park.&#13;
&#13;
The sacred process and traditions of deconstruction and rebuilding utilized traditional materials and construction techniques, and was completed in September of 2015.&amp;amp;nbsp; Every element of the Hun&amp;amp;rsquo;ges architecture contains spiritual significance, and the Roundhouse continues to be used by today&amp;amp;rsquo;s local tribes for private ceremonies.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
ROUNDHOUSE ETIQUETTE&#13;

Thanks to Jackson antiques dealer and organizer John MottoRos, and the Automatic Musical Collectors&amp;amp;rsquo; Association, music lovers of all ages and fans of all things antique have a chance to see, hear, and learn about these mechanical instruments that have entertained people for centuries. Their colorful musician-operators are always happy to answer questions about the music and the instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The organs heard today are based on instruments produced in France, but more popularly thought to have originated in Holland or Germany. In the eighteenth century, the first mechanical organs, turned by a crank, were invented to teach canaries to sing. Soon owners realized they could earn money playing outside. That was the beginning of organ grinders. In the U.S., Wurlitzer Co. manufactured player organs for merry-go-rounds that are still a favorite in parks and at county fairs.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

Strolling Main Street from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 12 noon on Sunday, this free musical treat features beautiful vintage organs ranging from &amp;amp;ldquo;monkey grinder&amp;amp;rdquo; size to majestic. The mechanical &amp;amp;nbsp;instruments play a variety of melodies, from dance tunes and marches to carousel and classical pieces.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Known as nickelodeons, music boxes, pianos, and dance hall organs, musical organs play perforated punch cards, &amp;amp;ldquo;books,&amp;amp;rdquo; or player piano rolls, and were featured attractions at fairgrounds and dance halls until the mid-1900s.&#13;
See these wonderful machines work and learn a little about America&amp;amp;rsquo;s past. A free one-of-a-kind opportunity for the whole family!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

On Sunday at 1 pm, the musical organs will assemble for a free indoor concert at:&#13;

Thanks to Jackson antiques dealer and organizer John MottoRos, and the Automatic Musical Collectors&amp;amp;rsquo; Association, music lovers of all ages and fans of all things antique have a chance to see, hear, and learn about these mechanical instruments that have entertained people for centuries. Their colorful musician-operators are always happy to answer questions about the music and the instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The organs heard today are based on instruments produced in France, but more popularly thought to have originated in Holland or Germany. In the eighteenth century, the first mechanical organs, turned by a crank, were invented to teach canaries to sing. Soon owners realized they could earn money playing outside. That was the beginning of organ grinders. In the U.S., Wurlitzer Co. manufactured player organs for merry-go-rounds that are still a favorite in parks and at county fairs.&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

Founded in 2010, the &amp;amp;ldquo;Clark&amp;amp;rsquo;s Corner Cycling Challenge,&amp;amp;rdquo; (CCCC) is an annual cycling event/group ride held annually, starting in beautiful Ione, CA, and circling through Amador County.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The Clark&amp;amp;#39;s Corner Cycling Challenge was designed as a way to give to charitable causes, promote business in the City of Ione and County of Amador, encourage community wellness, and share the amazing cycling we have around Ione.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;

&#13;
Quote from Chris Horner: &amp;amp;ldquo;I love riding in the &amp;amp;lsquo;Clark&amp;amp;rsquo;s Corner Cycling Challenge,&amp;amp;rsquo; and am happy to be back with the cyclists in Northern California. After the big win a few weeks ago at the &amp;amp;lsquo;Tour of Spain,&amp;amp;rsquo; I was excited to be returning for a fun ride in Amador County, because Northern California has a very loyal and enthusiastic cycling community. It was great! I&amp;amp;rsquo;m really glad I could make it&amp;amp;rdquo; - October 2013&#13;

They seek to enhance the level of art in our community, to foster the importance of music in one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own life through performance, to provide an opportunity for our talented youth to grow and perform, and to bring enjoyable and quality music to you, our friends and supporters...and we look forward to seeing you at our next performance!&#13;

    <Body>The game&amp;amp;#39;s afoot at Baker Street West in Hein and Company Books and Vintage Goods!&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
A Mecca for all things Sherlockian including a museum-quality reproduction of Holmes&amp;amp;#39;s and Watson&amp;amp;#39;s sitting room, otherwise known as 221B Baker Street.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Beth Barnard and Linda Hein are the eccentric creators of Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s Sherlockian Society, called Holmes&amp;amp;rsquo; Hounds. What began as two long-time friends discussing their favorite books and authors, has transformed into a community of whimsical individuals with a fascination of the most re-written character in history: Sherlock Holmes.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Whether you are versed in every detail of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&amp;amp;rsquo;s life, or you simply enjoy the BBC Sherlock series, the Holmes&amp;amp;rsquo; Hounds Sherlockian Society cordially invites you to visit 221B Baker Street and investigate for yourself.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Meetings are held bi-monthly, on the first Tuesday of odd-numbered months, at 6 p.m., in the upstairs of Jackson Main Street&amp;amp;rsquo;s Hein &amp;amp;amp; Company Bookstore.&#13;

    <Name>AmadorArts Winefest</Name>
    <Body>Annually, 2nd Saturday in November&#13;
&#13;
4:00-9:00pm&#13;
&#13;
November 11, 2017&#13;
&#13;
The annual Winefest in Sutter Creek is a popular walk-about wine-tasting event. Stroll historic Main Street while tasting a huge selection of Amador County wines in Sutter Creek&amp;amp;rsquo;s shops. Follow the adage &amp;amp;ldquo;Save Water, Drink Wine,&amp;amp;rdquo; and you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll be helping to bring the arts to local schools.&#13;
&#13;
Guests may check-in to pick up their wine glass, wristband and tasting map at the Sutter Creek Auditorium starting at 4:00 pm. Take a look at the huge silent auctions, one for Art, for Wine, and a Table for Premier Gifts and Travel Packages.&amp;amp;nbsp; Start bidding while sampling Amador Olive Oils. Then from 4:30 to 7:00 pm, walk up and down the three blocks of historic Main Street visiting over 20 shops where each one will be offering tastings of a different fine Amador County winery.&amp;amp;nbsp; Just remember: the law states that no wine can be in your glass when you&amp;amp;rsquo;re outside the shops.&#13;
&#13;
At 7:00 pm, return to the Auditorium for the Winefest festive Grand Finale, which will feature live music, desserts, more wine and our HUGE silent auction including Wine, Art and Gifts. The Winefest event ends at 9:00 pm.&#13;
&#13;
Advance tickets are $30 each, or $35 the day of the event at the auditorium starting at 4:00 pm. By purchasing you ticket right here, your printed PayPal receipt will be your ticket to save time at the auditorium&amp;amp;rsquo;s check-in.&amp;amp;nbsp; These local locations have tickets to sell: Amador Council of Tourism Office in Sutter Hill; Le Mulet Rouge in Sutter Creek; Amador Chamber of Commerce, Main St., Jackson. Dr.Curry&amp;amp;rsquo;s Dental Office in Plymouth, and Up Country Hardware in Pine Grove.&#13;
&#13;
Sales of tickets are limited this year, so now&amp;amp;rsquo;s the time to contact your friends, book your dinner or lodging reservations, possibly a limo, and generally prepare for this greatest fundraiser of the year for AmadorArts. Proceeds of the Winefest provide much-needed funds for arts in education in local schools and in the community.&#13;

The Terre Rouge Ascent is a limited production wine made each year from their most interesting Syrah lots from high elevation vineyard sites.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
The wine is aged for 2 years in a special French oak barrel program. This is a special winemaker&amp;amp;#39;s blend that is thier&amp;amp;nbsp;top Syrah bottling.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Bill Easton has been making the Ascent since the 1999 vintage, garnering praise for each vintage. These wines are powerful and can cellar for at least 20 years.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
While you taste, enjoy Jane&amp;amp;rsquo;s Recover from Thanksgiving Soup. Bring the family and enjoy a great afternoon and if the weather is nice, play a little petanque.&#13;

A Mecca for all things Sherlockian including a museum-quality reproduction of Holmes&amp;amp;#39;s and Watson&amp;amp;#39;s sitting room, otherwise known as 221B Baker Street.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Beth Barnard and Linda Hein are the eccentric creators of Amador County&amp;amp;rsquo;s Sherlockian Society, called Holmes&amp;amp;rsquo; Hounds. What began as two long-time friends discussing their favorite books and authors, has transformed into a community of whimsical individuals with a fascination of the most re-written character in history: Sherlock Holmes.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Whether you are versed in every detail of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&amp;amp;rsquo;s life, or you simply enjoy the BBC Sherlock series, the Holmes&amp;amp;rsquo; Hounds Sherlockian Society cordially invites you to visit 221B Baker Street and investigate for yourself.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Meetings are held bi-monthly, on the first Tuesday of odd-numbered months, at 6 p.m., in the upstairs of Jackson Main Street&amp;amp;rsquo;s Hein &amp;amp;amp; Company Bookstore.&#13;

    <Name>Serbian Christmas</Name>
    <Body>For over 100 years our Serbian-American population has celebrated on the 7th day of January, (13 days after December 25th) with a volley of rifle shots to announce that Christ Is Born.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
There is a procession through Main St. Jackson starting approximately 12pm. The traditional volley of shots (with a police escort) in front of the National Hotel, St. Sava&amp;amp;#39;s Church on North Main St., and St. Sava&amp;amp;#39;s Mission on Broadway herald this unique local celebration.&#13;
&#13;
&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
Know that you are safe and all is well as the rifles are not loaded with live rounds. It&amp;amp;#39;s your neighbor celebrating and keeping alive the rich traditions of the old country and wishing you every happiness this Holiday Season with great prosperity and good health in the New Year!&amp;amp;nbsp;&#13;
